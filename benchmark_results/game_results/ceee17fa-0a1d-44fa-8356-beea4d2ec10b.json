I need to start with fundamental divisions that can broadly categorize possibilities\n2. Each question should efficiently split the search space\n3. Questions should be specific and clear with yes/no answers\n4. Avoid common mistakes like listing multiple options in one question\n5. Track progress and build a mental model\n6. Be decisive - guess when reasonably confident\n7. Be prepared to pivot if answers seem inconsistent\n8.

Cryptocurrency adoption is growing but remains relatively niche compared to traditional financial systems. Many people have heard of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but a smaller percentage actually own, use, or regularly think about them.\n\nSome considerations:\n- Cryptocurrency ownership is still limited to a minority of the global population\n- Most daily transactions around the world are still conducted using traditional currencies\n- While media coverage has increased awareness, cryptocurrency isn't part of most people's regular routines\n- In certain countries or tech-focused communities, cryptocurrency might be more prevalent, but not for the general global population\n\nBased on these considerations, I think \"no\" is the most accurate answer, though with increasing awareness, this could change in the future."

Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies that use cryptography for security and operate on technology called blockchain, which is a distributed ledger technology. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies rely heavily on computer science, cryptography (a branch of both mathematics and computer science), and modern technology infrastructure.\n\nSo the answer is clearly \"yes\" - cryptocurrency is related to technology."
