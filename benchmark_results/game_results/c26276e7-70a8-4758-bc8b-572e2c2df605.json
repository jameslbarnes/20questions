I need to start with broad, fundamental divisions that will help me narrow down the universe of possibilities efficiently.\n\nFor my first question, I should try to determine if what they're thinking of is a physical, tangible object or something abstract (like an idea, concept, emotion, etc.). This is one of the most fundamental divisions possible.\n\nQuestion 1: \"Is it a physical/tangible object?\""
