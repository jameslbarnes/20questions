Let me start with the broadest possible questions that divide the universe of possibilities.\n\nFor my first question, I want to establish the most fundamental division possible. The division between physical/tangible things and abstract/conceptual things is one of the broadest splits possible, so I'll start there.\n\nQuestion 1: \"Is it physical/tangible?\"\n\nThis will immediately tell me if we're dealing with something concrete (like an object, animal, person, place) or something abstract (like an idea, emotion, concept, theory).\n\nFrom there, I'll continue to narrow down based on the answer using the binary tree approach to efficiently divide the remaining possibilities."

Yes, it has electronic components like pickups that convert string vibrations into electrical signals.\n\n2. Does an electric guitar require power to function? This requires some nuance:\n   - An electric guitar can be physically played without power/amplification, and the strings will vibrate and make sound.\n   - However, the defining characteristic of an electric guitar is that it needs to be plugged into an amplifier (which requires power) to produce its intended sound at performance volume.\n   - The pickups themselves don't require batteries or direct power to function - they generate small electrical signals when strings vibrate over them.\n\nGiven the nature of electric guitars, I would say \"yes\" to this question. While you can technically strum an electric guitar unplugged and hear a faint sound, its primary function as an electric instrument requires electrical power (through an amplifier) to operate as intended. The electronic pickups and the need for amplification are fundamental to what makes it an electric guitar rather than an acoustic guitar."

They're fundamental tools in many genres of music like rock, blues, jazz, metal, pop, etc.\n\nWhile electric guitars can be used for practice and learning (which is not strictly entertainment), their primary purpose is to create music for entertainment.

      "thinking": "Let me think about the question and the object (electric guitar) I'm supposed to be thinking of:\n\nThe question asks if it's a standard 6-string electric guitar (as opposed to specialty types).\n\nElectric guitars typically come in several configurations:\n- Standard 6-string electric guitars (the most common type)\n- 7, 8, or more string electric guitars\n- 12-string electric guitars\n- Baritone electric guitars\n- Acoustic-electric hybrids\n\nSince I'm thinking of an \"electric guitar\" without any specific qualifiers, the most straightforward interpretation would be a standard 6-string electric guitar, which is the most common type.\n\nThe question specifically contrasts with \"specialty\" types like 12-strings or acoustic-electrics, which confirms that they're asking if I'm thinking of the standard type.\n\nSo, is what I'm thinking of (electric guitar) a standard 6-string electric guitar? Yes, that would be the default assumption when someone says \"electric guitar\" without qualifiers."
