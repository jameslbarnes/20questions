I'll start with very broad categories to divide the universe of possibilities efficiently.\n\nFor my first question, I should try to establish one of the most fundamental divisions: whether the thing is physical/tangible or abstract/conceptual. This is a good starting point because it immediately cuts the possibility space roughly in half.\n\nMy first question will be about whether the thing is physical or tangible."

This immediately eliminates abstract concepts, ideas, digital entities, emotions, etc.\n\nNow I need to continue dividing the space of possibilities. Let's consider some high-level categories for physical objects:\n\n1. Natural vs. man-made\n2. Living vs. non-living\n3. Size (is it larger than a microwave/bread box/etc.)\n4. Location (is it typically found indoors vs. outdoors)\n\nI think the most fundamental division would be to determine if it's a natural object or something manufactured/man-made. This will effectively split the remaining possibilities roughly in half.\n\nSo, my next question will be about whether the object is natural or man-made:"

Natural objects could include:\n- Living organisms (plants, animals)\n- Geological formations (mountains, rocks)\n- Celestial bodies (planets, stars)\n- Natural elements (water, air)\n- Naturally occurring substances (minerals, gems)\n\nA good dividing question would be to determine if it's alive or not.\n\nAfter that, depending on the answer, I can further narrow down to specific categories of living or non-living natural objects."

They are formed from clouds of gas and dust in space through gravitational collapse, not through biological processes.\n\nStars are natural celestial objects that undergo nuclear fusion in their cores, but they are not considered alive by any scientific definition of life.
