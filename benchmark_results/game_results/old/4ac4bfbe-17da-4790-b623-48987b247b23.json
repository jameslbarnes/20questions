    "I'll play 20 Questions and use strategic questioning to identify what you're thinking of.\n\nQuestion 1: Is it a physical, tangible object?",
    "I'll continue with strategic questioning to identify the physical object you're thinking of.\n\nQuestion 2: Is this object larger than a microwave oven?",
    "I'll continue with strategic questioning to narrow down this physical object that's larger than a microwave.\n\nQuestion 3: Is this object typically found inside a home?\nAnswer:",
    "I'll continue with strategic questioning to identify this physical, tangible object that's larger than a microwave and typically not found inside a home.\n\nQuestion 4: Is this object a naturally occurring thing (as opposed to something manufactured or built by humans)?",
    "Question 5: Is this object a living organism?",
    "I'll continue with strategic questioning to identify this physical, tangible, naturally occurring object that's larger than a microwave, not typically found in homes, and is not a living organism.\n\nQuestion 6: Is this object a geographical feature (like a mountain, lake, river, etc.)?\nAnswer:",
    "I'll continue with strategic questioning to identify this physical, tangible, naturally occurring object that's larger than a microwave, not typically found in homes, not a living organism, and not a geographical feature.\n\nQuestion 7: Is this object found on Earth (as opposed to being found in space or on another celestial body)?",
    "I'll continue with strategic questioning to identify this physical, tangible, naturally occurring object that's larger than a microwave, not typically found in homes, not a living organism, not a geographical feature, but is found on Earth.\n\nQuestion 8: Is this object primarily made of or contains mineral substances (like rocks, metals, crystals, etc.)?\nAnswer:",
    "I'll continue with strategic questioning to identify this physical, tangible, naturally occurring object that's larger than a microwave, not typically found in homes, not a living organism, not a geographical feature, found on Earth, and not primarily made of mineral substances.\n\nQuestion 9: Is this object primarily made of or derived from plant material (like a tree, fruit, etc.)?\nAnswer:",
    "I'll continue with strategic questioning to identify this physical, tangible, naturally occurring object that's larger than a microwave, not typically found in homes, not a living organism, not a geographical feature, found on Earth, and not primarily made of mineral or plant substances.\n\nQuestion 10: Is this object primarily made of or derived from animal material (like bones, fur, etc.)?\nAnswer:",
    "I'll continue with strategic questioning to identify this physical, tangible, naturally occurring object that's larger than a microwave, not typically found in homes, not a living organism, not a geographical feature, found on Earth, and not primarily made of mineral, plant, or animal substances.\n\nQuestion 11: Is this object a weather phenomenon (like a cloud, tornado, rainbow, etc.)?\nAnswer:",
    "I'll continue with strategic questioning to identify this physical, tangible, naturally occurring object that's larger than a microwave, not typically found in homes, not a living organism, not a geographical feature, found on Earth, and not primarily made of mineral, plant, or animal substances, and not a weather phenomenon.\n\nQuestion 12: Is this object primarily made of or consists mainly of water (like an ocean, lake, etc.)?",
    "I need to think carefully about what remains as possibilities. I have a naturally occurring physical object that's larger than a microwave, not found in homes, not a living organism, not a geographical feature, found on Earth, not made of minerals, plants, or animals, not a weather phenomenon, and not primarily water.\n\nQuestion 13: Is this object a naturally formed collection or accumulation of something (like a sand dune, snow drift, etc.)?",
    "I need to reconsider what naturally occurring physical objects remain that fit all these criteria. This is challenging as we've eliminated many major categories.\n\nQuestion 14: Is this object primarily composed of or related to a gas or air (like a pocket of natural gas, atmosphere, etc.)?",
    "I'm finding this challenging as we've eliminated most major categories of naturally occurring physical objects. Let me think about what remains.\n\nQuestion 15: Is this object a specific instance or formation of something rather than a general category (like a specific iceberg or specific fossil, as opposed to \"icebergs\" or \"fossils\" as a category)?",
    "I need to reconsider what naturally occurring physical objects exist that meet all our criteria. I've eliminated living things, geographical features, minerals, plants, animals, weather phenomena, water bodies, collections/accumulations, and gases.\n\nQuestion 16: Is this object a fossil or fossilized remains of something that was once alive?",
    "I need to carefully reconsider what could remain in our search space. A naturally occurring, physical object larger than a microwave that's not a living organism, not a geographical feature, not primarily mineral, plant, animal, water, gas, or a fossil, and not a collection of something.\n\nQuestion 17: Is this object something that can be observed in the sky (like a celestial body, aurora, etc.)?",
    "I'll continue with strategic questioning to identify this physical, tangible, naturally occurring object that's larger than a microwave, observed in the sky, found on Earth (but not in homes), not a living organism, not a geographical feature, not primarily made of mineral, plant, or animal substances, not a weather phenomenon, and not a specific instance of something.\n\nQuestion 18: Is this object a celestial body (like the sun, moon, or a planet) as opposed to an atmospheric phenomenon?\nAnswer:",
    "I'll continue with strategic questioning to identify this celestial body that's visible from Earth.\n\nQuestion 19: Is this celestial body part of our solar system (as opposed to a star or galaxy outside our solar system)?",
    "Based on the information gathered, I'm looking for a celestial body in our solar system that is naturally occurring, physical, larger than a microwave, visible from Earth, and not a living organism.\n\nQuestion 20: Is this celestial body one of the planets in our solar system (as opposed to the sun, a moon, asteroid, or comet)?"
