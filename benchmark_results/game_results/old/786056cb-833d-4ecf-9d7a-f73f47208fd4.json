    "# 20 Questions Game\n\nI'll help you identify what you're thinking of through strategic yes/no questions.\n\nMy first question: Is it something physical/tangible?",
    "Question 2: Is it something naturally occurring (not manufactured by humans)?",
    "Question 3: Is it a living organism (or part of one)?",
    "Question 4: Is it something found on Earth?",
    "Question 5: Is it a discrete celestial body (like a planet, moon, star, asteroid)?",
    "Question 6: Is it a phenomenon or process (like a black hole, supernova, gravitational waves) rather than a substance or material?",
    "Question 7: Can this phenomenon or process be directly observed or detected with current human technology?",
    "Question 8: Is this phenomenon related to electromagnetic radiation (like light, radio waves, gamma rays, etc.)?",
    "Question 9: Is this phenomenon a discrete event that occurs at specific times (like a burst or explosion) rather than a continuous process?",
    "Question 10: Is this phenomenon specifically associated with stars or stellar processes (like stellar radiation, solar wind, etc.)?",
    "Question 11: Is this phenomenon related to the early universe or cosmological in nature (like cosmic background radiation)?",
    "Question 12: Is this phenomenon observed primarily in the microwave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum?",
    "Question 13: Is this phenomenon primarily observed in high-energy portions of the electromagnetic spectrum (such as X-rays or gamma rays)?",
    "Question 14: Is this phenomenon directly related to the expansion of the universe or its measurement?",
    "Question 15: Is this phenomenon observed primarily in the visible or infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum?",
    "Question 16: Is this phenomenon related to or caused by gravitational effects?",
    "Question 17: Is this phenomenon related to the bending or deflection of light by massive objects?",
    "Question 18: Is this phenomenon specifically gravitational lensing (the bending of light from distant objects around massive objects in between, creating distorted or multiple images)?",
    "Question 19: Are you thinking of a specific, well-known example of gravitational lensing (such as the Einstein Cross or the Cosmic Horseshoe)?",
    "Question 20: Is your answer the general phenomenon of gravitational lensing itself, rather than a specific type or subcategory of gravitational lensing (such as microlensing or strong/weak lensing)?"

  "question_count": 20,
  "final_guess": "Strong gravitational lensing\n\nBased on our process of elimination, I've determined this is a specific type of gravitational lensing rather than the general phenomenon itself or a particular example. Strong gravitational lensing occurs when massive objects (like galaxy clusters) significantly distort light from background objects, creating dramatic arcs, rings, or multiple images that can be observed in the visible/infrared spectrum. As a cosmological phenomenon not found on Earth, caused by gravity bending light, and observable with current technology, strong lensing best fits all the criteria we've established.",
