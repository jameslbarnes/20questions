    "I'll play 20 Questions by following the strategy you've outlined. Let me start with a fundamental question that divides the universe of possibilities.\n\nQuestion 1: Is it a physical/tangible object?",
    "I'll continue with strategic questions to narrow down the possibilities.\n\nQuestion 2: Is this physical object larger than a microwave oven?",
    "I'll continue with strategic questions to narrow down the possibilities of this physical object that's smaller than a microwave oven.\n\nQuestion 3: Is this object primarily used inside a home/residence?\nAnswer:",
    "Thank you for the \"Maybe\" answer, which suggests this object might be used in homes but isn't exclusively for home use.\n\nQuestion 4: Is this object something that a person would typically carry with them when they leave their home (like in a pocket, purse, or bag)?",
    "I see we have some uncertainty about the usage context. Let me explore the nature of this object more directly.\n\nQuestion 5: Is this object primarily designed to perform a mechanical or electronic function (as opposed to being decorative or passive)?\nAnswer:",
    "I'll continue with strategic questions to narrow down the possibilities of this small physical object that isn't primarily designed for a mechanical or electronic function.\n\nQuestion 6: Is this object made primarily of natural materials (like wood, stone, cotton, leather) rather than synthetic/manufactured materials?\nAnswer:",
    "I'm building a mental model of what we know so far: a physical, tangible object smaller than a microwave, possibly used in homes and possibly carried by people, not primarily designed for mechanical/electronic functions, and made primarily of natural materials.\n\nQuestion 7: Is this object used for personal adornment or decoration (like jewelry, accessories, decorative items)?",
    "I'll continue narrowing down the possibilities with strategic questions.\n\nQuestion 8: Is this object used for consuming food or beverages (like a cup, plate, utensil, or food item itself)?\nAnswer:",
    "I now know this is a small physical object made primarily of natural materials, used for consuming food or beverages. Let me narrow this down further.\n\nQuestion 9: Is this object a food or beverage item itself (rather than a tool/container for consuming food/beverages)?\nAnswer:",
    "Thank you for the update. Let me analyze what I know so far:\n\nThis is:\n- A physical/tangible object\n- Smaller than a microwave oven\n- Maybe used inside a home/residence\n- Maybe carried with a person when they leave home\n- Not primarily designed for mechanical/electronic function\n- Made primarily of natural materials\n- Not used for personal adornment/decoration\n- Used for consuming food or beverages\n- Is a food or beverage item itself (not a tool/container)\n\nQuestion 10: Is this object a solid food item (as opposed to a liquid beverage)?",
    "I'll continue narrowing down the possibilities of this solid food item.\n\nQuestion 11: Is this food item something that can be eaten without any cooking or preparation (ready to eat as is)?\nAnswer:",
    "I appreciate the detailed tracking. I'll continue narrowing down this ready-to-eat solid food item.\n\nQuestion 12: Is this food item a fruit?",
    "Thank you for tracking our progress. Let's continue narrowing down this ready-to-eat fruit.\n\nQuestion 13: Is this fruit commonly grown in tropical or subtropical climates?",
    "I understand the progress we've made so far. This is:\n- A physical/tangible object\n- A solid food item\n- Smaller than a microwave oven\n- Made primarily of natural materials\n- Used for consuming food/beverages (because it is food)\n- Ready to eat without cooking/preparation\n- Is a fruit\n- Not commonly grown in tropical/subtropical climates (so likely a temperate climate fruit)\n\nQuestion 14: Is this fruit typically round in shape?",
    "Based on what I know so far, this is:\n- A physical/tangible object\n- A solid food item\n- Smaller than a microwave oven\n- Made primarily of natural materials\n- Ready to eat without cooking/preparation\n- Is a fruit\n- Not tropical/subtropical (temperate climate fruit)\n- Typically round in shape\n\nQuestion 15: Is this fruit typically red when ripe?",
    "I'm narrowing down the possibilities based on what I know:\n- A physical/tangible object\n- A solid food item (fruit)\n- Smaller than a microwave oven\n- Made primarily of natural materials\n- Ready to eat without cooking/preparation\n- Temperate climate fruit (not tropical)\n- Typically round in shape\n- Typically red when ripe\n\nQuestion 16: Is this fruit an apple?\nAnswer:"
