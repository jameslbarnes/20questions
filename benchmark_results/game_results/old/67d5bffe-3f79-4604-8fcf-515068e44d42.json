    "Let me start with a fundamental dividing question:\n\nIs it a physical, tangible object (something you can touch)?",
    "Since it's a physical object, let me establish its scale.\n\nQuestion 2: Is it larger than a microwave oven?\n\nThis question helps divide physical objects into rough size categories and will guide whether I should focus on household items, furniture, vehicles, buildings, etc.",
    "Let me analyze what we know:\n- It's a physical, tangible object\n- It's larger than a microwave oven\n\nFor my next question, I want to determine if it's something primarily found indoors or outdoors, as this will help narrow down the context and likely usage.\n\nQuestion 3: Is it typically found/kept indoors (inside buildings)?",
    "Let me analyze what we know:\n- It's a physical, tangible object\n- It's larger than a microwave oven\n- It's typically found outdoors\n\nFor my next question, I want to determine if it's a man-made object versus something natural, as this will help narrow down a huge category of possibilities.\n\nQuestion 4: Is it man-made (as opposed to naturally occurring)?\nAnswer: Yes.",
    "Let me analyze what we know:\n- It's a physical, tangible object\n- It's larger than a microwave oven\n- It's typically found outdoors\n- It's man-made\n\nGiven these characteristics, I want to determine if it's something used for transportation, as this is a major category of large outdoor man-made objects.\n\nQuestion 5: Is it used for transportation (of people or goods)?",
    "Let me analyze what we know:\n- It's a physical, tangible object\n- It's larger than a microwave oven\n- It's typically found outdoors\n- It's man-made\n- It's used for transportation\n\nThis strongly suggests we're dealing with some kind of vehicle. Let me narrow down the type of transportation.\n\nQuestion 6: Does it primarily travel on land (as opposed to air or water)?\n\nThis question will help determine whether we're dealing with a land vehicle (like a car, truck, train) versus aircraft or watercraft.",
    "Let me analyze what we know:\n- It's a physical, tangible object\n- It's larger than a microwave oven\n- It's typically found outdoors\n- It's man-made\n- It's used for transportation\n- It travels primarily on land\n\nWe're clearly dealing with a land vehicle. Given its size and characteristics, I want to determine if it's designed for mass transit versus individual/small group transportation.\n\nQuestion 7: Is it used for mass public transportation (like a bus or train)?\n\nThis will help distinguish between personal vehicles and larger public transportation systems.",
    "Let me analyze what we know:\n- It's a physical, tangible object\n- It's larger than a microwave oven\n- It's typically found outdoors\n- It's man-made\n- It's used for transportation\n- It travels primarily on land\n- It's NOT used for mass public transportation\n\nSince it's a land vehicle larger than a microwave but not for public transit, it's likely either a personal vehicle or commercial/industrial vehicle. Let me narrow this down.\n\nQuestion 8: Is it primarily used for transporting cargo/goods (rather than people)?\n\nThis will help determine if we're dealing with something like a truck/van versus a passenger vehicle.",

Given its size and characteristics, I want to determine if it's a standard passenger vehicle or something more specialized.\n\nQuestion 9: Is it a car/automobile (a standard 4-wheeled passenger vehicle)?\n\nThis will help determine if we're dealing with a standard car versus other types of personal vehicles like motorcycles, RVs, or specialized recreational vehicles."
