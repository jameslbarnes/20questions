    "Based on all the information - it's a passenger road vehicle, not larger than a standard car, can seat more than 2 people, primarily for passengers - I'm reasonably confident this is a typical passenger car.\n\n<guess>Car (sedan/hatchback)</guess>\n\nThe pattern of answers strongly suggests a standard passenger automobile: it's a manufactured object, used for transportation on roads, designed for multiple passengers, and of the appropriate size category."
