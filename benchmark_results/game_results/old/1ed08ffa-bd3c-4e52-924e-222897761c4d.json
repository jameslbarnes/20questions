    "Is it a physical object (something you can touch)?",
    "Question 2: Is it larger than a microwave oven?",
    "Is it something commonly found in households?",
    "Is it something typically used in the kitchen?",
    "Is it used for food preparation (like cutting, mixing, measuring)?",
    "Given the uncertainty about food preparation, I'll try to narrow down its primary purpose.\n\nQuestion 6: Is it used for eating or drinking (like utensils, cups, plates)?\nAnswer?",
    "Let me analyze what we know:\n- Physical object smaller than a microwave\n- Commonly found in households\n- Used in kitchen\n- Not primarily for eating/drinking\n- Uncertain about food preparation\n\nQuestion 7: Is it used for storing food or ingredients (like containers, jars, etc.)?",
    "Let me analyze:\n- Kitchen item\n- Not for eating/drinking\n- Not for storage\n- Not definitively for food prep\n- Smaller than microwave\n- Common in households\n\nLet me try to determine if it's an appliance or tool.\n\nQuestion 8: Is it powered by electricity?\nAnswer?",
    "Let's analyze what we know:\n- Kitchen electrical device\n- Smaller than microwave\n- Not primarily for eating/drinking/storage\n- Common in households\n- Possibly used in food prep\n\nThis narrows it down to small kitchen appliances. Given the ambiguity about food prep, I'll ask:\n\nQuestion 9: Is it used to heat or cook food?",
    "Let's analyze what we know:\n- Small kitchen electrical device\n- Used to heat/cook food\n- Smaller than microwave\n- Common in households\n\nGiven these clues, let me narrow down between the most common small heating appliances.\n\nQuestion 10: Is it a toaster?",
    "Let's analyze what we know:\n- Small kitchen electrical device\n- Used to heat/cook food\n- Smaller than microwave\n- Common in households\n- Not a toaster\n\nQuestion 11: Can it be used to heat liquids?\nAnswer?",
    "Let's analyze what we know:\n- Small kitchen electrical device\n- Used to heat/cook food and liquids\n- Smaller than microwave\n- Common in households\n- Not a toaster\n\nGiven that it can heat liquids and is a common household appliance, I'm fairly confident, but I'll ask one more question to be sure.\n\nQuestion 12: Is it a kettle/electric kettle?",
    "Let's analyze what we know:\n- Small kitchen electrical device\n- Used to heat/cook food and liquids\n- Smaller than microwave\n- Common in households\n- Not a toaster\n- Not a kettle\n- Not primarily for storage\n- Not primarily for eating/drinking\n\nGiven these clues and the eliminated options, let me try to understand its versatility.\n\nQuestion 13: Can it be used to warm up coffee or other beverages?\nAnswer?",
    "Let's analyze what we know:\n- Small kitchen electrical device\n- Used to heat/cook food and liquids\n- Can warm up coffee/beverages\n- Smaller than microwave\n- Common in households\n- Not a toaster\n- Not a kettle\n\nGiven these clues, and especially the ability to warm beverages and other items, I'm ready to make a guess.",
    "(Incorrect guess: A coffee warmer/hot plate)",
    "Let me continue with more questions to narrow this down.\n\nQuestion 15: Is it used primarily to heat a single serving or small portion at a time?\nAnswer?",
    "Let's analyze what we know:\n- Small kitchen electrical device\n- Used to heat/cook food and liquids\n- Can warm up coffee/beverages\n- Smaller than microwave\n- Common in households\n- Not a toaster\n- Not a kettle\n- Not a coffee warmer/hot plate\n\nQuestion 16: Does it have buttons or a dial to control different temperature settings?\nAnswer?",
    "Let's analyze what we know:\n- Small kitchen electrical device\n- Used to heat/cook food and liquids\n- Can warm up coffee/beverages\n- Heats single servings/small portions\n- Smaller than microwave\n- Common in households\n- Not a toaster\n- Not a kettle\n\nGiven the focus on single servings and its versatility with both food and beverages, I'm ready to try another guess.",
    "(Incorrect guess: a mug warmer\n(If this is incorrect, please let me know and I can continue with more questions))",
    "Let me analyze the information carefully:\n- Small kitchen electrical device\n- Used to heat/cook food and liquids, including coffee\n- Heats single servings\n- Smaller than microwave\n- Common in households\n- Not a toaster, kettle, or coffee warmer/hot plate\n\nQuestion 18: Can it be used to steam or heat milk for coffee drinks?\nAnswer?",
    "Let's analyze what we know:\n- Small kitchen electrical device\n- Used to heat/cook food and liquids\n- Can warm up coffee/beverages\n- Heats single servings/small portions\n- Smaller than microwave\n- Common in households\n- Not a toaster\n- Not a kettle\n- No buttons/dials for temperature control\n- Not a coffee warmer/hot plate\n\nQuestion 19: Is it long and cylindrical in shape?",
