    "# 20 Questions Game\n\nI'll start with a fundamental question to help divide the possibilities:\n\nIs it something physical/tangible (as opposed to an abstract concept or idea)?",
    "Question 2: Is it something that depends on human existence or human society to exist (as opposed to something that could exist independently of humans)?",
    "Question 3: Is it related to formal social structures or systems (like government, economics, law, education) as opposed to more personal/individual experiences (like emotions, personal beliefs)?",
    "Question 4: Is it primarily related to economics or financial systems (as opposed to political, legal, or educational systems)?",
    "Question 5: Is it related to governance or political systems (such as types of government, political processes, or mechanisms of authority)?",
    "Question 6: Is it related to legal systems or law (such as legal concepts, institutions, or processes of justice)?",
    "Question 7: Is it related to educational systems or institutions (such as schools, universities, or formal learning processes)?",
    "Question 8: Is it related to religious or spiritual institutions/systems (like organized religions, belief systems, or faith practices)?",
    "Question 9: Is it related to healthcare systems (such as hospitals, medical institutions, or public health frameworks)?",
    "Question 10: Is it related to communication, information, or media systems (such as news organizations, entertainment industries, social media platforms, or information networks)?",
    "Question 11: Is it related to cultural institutions or systems (such as arts organizations, museums, heritage preservation, cultural traditions, or entertainment structures)?",
    "Question 12: Is it a specific cultural practice, tradition, or event (like a festival, ceremony, or ritual) rather than a broader cultural concept or institution?",
    "Question 13: Is it related to artistic expression or the arts (such as visual arts, performing arts, literature, music) rather than other aspects of culture?",
    "Question 14: Is it related to cultural heritage, preservation, or the documentation/maintenance of cultural identities (such as museums, archives, or cultural preservation organizations)?",
    "Question 15: Is it a specific institution or organization (like UNESCO, a specific museum, or a heritage foundation) rather than a broader concept or framework related to cultural preservation?",
    "Question 16: Is it a broad concept specifically focused on preserving intangible aspects of cultural heritage (such as language, traditions, knowledge) rather than physical artifacts or sites?",
    "Question 17: Is it primarily concerned with passing down knowledge, practices, or traditions through generations (such as oral history or traditional knowledge transmission) rather than other aspects of cultural preservation?",
    "Question 18: Is it related to the protection or recognition of cultural diversity (the variety of cultures) rather than the preservation of specific cultural elements?",
    "Question 19: Is it a principle, policy, or concept that specifically promotes the coexistence of multiple cultural identities within a single society or nation, rather than just protecting diversity in general?",
    "Question 20: Is it the general concept of \"cultural diversity\" itself (the existence of variety in cultures worldwide) rather than a more specific framework or approach to preserving heritage?"
