    "I'll play 20 Questions using optimal strategy to identify the unknown entity.\n\nQuestion 1: Is it a physical object (as opposed to an abstract concept, event, or idea)?",
    "Question 2: Is it larger than a microwave oven?\nAnswer:",

    "I'll continue narrowing down systematically.\n\nQuestion 4: Is it an electronic or electrical device?",
    "Question 5: Is it primarily used in the kitchen or for food preparation/consumption?",
    "I'll continue narrowing down systematically.\n\nQuestion 6: Is it a utensil or tool used to eat or serve food (as opposed to preparing food)?\nAnswer:",
    "I'll continue narrowing down systematically.\n\nQuestion 7: Is it a container or vessel used to store, hold, or cook food?\nAnswer:",
    "I need to think more carefully about this. It's a physical object smaller than a microwave, commonly found in households, used in the kitchen or for food preparation, but it's not an electronic device, not a utensil/tool for eating or serving, and not a container/vessel.\n\nQuestion 8: Is it a tool or implement primarily used for cutting or slicing food?\nAnswer:",
    "I need to carefully consider what I know. The object is:\n- Physical, smaller than a microwave\n- Commonly found in households\n- Used in the kitchen or for food preparation\n- Not electronic/electrical\n- Not for eating/serving food\n- Not a container/vessel for food\n- Not for cutting/slicing food\n\nQuestion 9: Is it a tool or implement used for measuring ingredients when cooking or baking?",
    "I need to think more carefully about kitchen items that don't fit into the categories I've already eliminated.\n\nQuestion 10: Is it used to clean dishes, cookware, or kitchen surfaces?\nAnswer:",
    "I need to reconsider what I know. The object is:\n- Physical, smaller than a microwave\n- Commonly found in households\n- Used in the kitchen or for food preparation\n- Not electronic/electrical\n- Not for eating/serving food\n- Not a container/vessel for food\n- Not for cutting/slicing food\n- Not for measuring ingredients\n- Not for cleaning\n\nQuestion 11: Is it used to mix or blend ingredients during food preparation?",
    "Let me reconsider all the information I have so far:\n- Physical object smaller than a microwave\n- Commonly found in households\n- Used in the kitchen or for food preparation\n- Not electronic/electrical\n- Not for eating/serving food\n- Not a container/vessel\n- Not for cutting/slicing\n- Not for measuring ingredients\n- Not for cleaning\n- Not for mixing/blending\n\nQuestion 12: Is it something used to open packages, cans, or containers of food?\nAnswer:",

    "Let me reconsider what I know about this kitchen item. It's a non-electronic physical object smaller than a microwave, commonly found in households, used for food preparation but not for serving/eating, storing, cutting, measuring, cleaning, mixing, opening packages, or protecting surfaces/hands.\n\nQuestion 14: Is it something used to season or flavor food (like salt, pepper, spices, or condiments)?\nAnswer:",
    "I need to carefully interpret this \"kind of\" answer. It suggests the item is related to seasoning or flavoring food, but not exactly a spice or condiment itself.\n\nQuestion 15: Is it a spice or herb specifically (rather than a condiment or other flavoring)?\nAnswer:",
    "I need to analyze what I know so far. The object is \"kind of\" related to seasoning or flavoring food, but is not a spice or herb specifically.\n\nQuestion 16: Is it a device or tool used to dispense, grind, or apply seasonings to food (like a salt/pepper shaker, grinder, or oil sprayer)?\nAnswer:",
    "I need to carefully reconsider the \"kind of\" response to the seasoning/flavoring question. The object is kitchen-related but doesn't fit neatly into the categories I've explored.\n\nQuestion 17: Is it an ingredient used in cooking or baking (like flour, sugar, or oil)?\nAnswer:",
    "I need to carefully analyze the \"kind of\" responses regarding seasoning/flavoring and ingredients. This suggests it's something that might be an ingredient or flavoring, but doesn't fit neatly into those categories.\n\nQuestion 18: Is it a liquid or semi-liquid substance used in cooking or food preparation (like vinegar, soy sauce, or cooking oil)?",
    "I need to carefully reconsider what I know. The object is kitchen-related, \"kind of\" related to both seasoning/flavoring and ingredients, but not a liquid/semi-liquid, not a spice/herb specifically, and not a dispensing tool.\n\nQuestion 19: Is it a cooking additive or enhancer that's neither a primary ingredient nor a traditional spice (like baking powder, yeast, or food coloring)?",
