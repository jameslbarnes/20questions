Let's start with the broadest possible questions that divide the universe of possibilities.\n\nI need to think about what question would effectively split the universe of possibilities in half. One of the most fundamental divisions is between physical/tangible things and abstract/intangible concepts.\n\nMy first question should be:\n\n\"Is it something physical/tangible?\"\n\nThis will help me determine whether we're dealing with:\n- Physical objects (like a chair, animal, or mountain)\n- Abstract concepts (like love, democracy, or a mathematical equation)\n\nLet me use the prescribed format:"

This eliminates a huge category of possible answers - all physical objects and materials in the world.\n\nSince it's not physical, it could be:\n1. A concept or idea (love, justice, mathematics)\n2. A digital entity (software, website, digital file)\n3. An emotion or feeling\n4. An event or occurrence\n5. A fictional character or place\n6. A service\n7. A system or process\n8. A time period\n9. A relationship\n\nFor my next question, I should try to divide these remaining possibilities efficiently. I'll ask if it's something that primarily exists in human minds (concepts, emotions, abstract ideas) versus something that has some external representation or existence beyond individual human minds (like digital entities, events, systems).\n\nGiven that it's not physical, another good division might be to ask if it's something that has a specific form or instance, or if it's more general/abstract."
