    "I'll start by asking a fundamental question that helps divide the universe of possibilities:\n\nIs it a physical/tangible object?",
    "Question 2: Is it a living organism (or was it once alive)?",
    "Question 3: Is it an animal (as opposed to a plant, fungus, or microorganism)?",
    "Question 4: Is it a plant?",
    "Question 5: Is it a tree (as opposed to a smaller plant like a flower, shrub, or grass)?",
    "Question 6: Is it a tree commonly found in temperate regions (as opposed to tropical or arctic regions)?",
    "Question 7: Is it a tree commonly found in tropical regions?",
    "Question 8: Is it a tree commonly found in desert or arid regions?",
    "Question 9: Is it a tree that exists in the present day (as opposed to being extinct or fictional)?",
    "Question 10: Is it an extinct tree (one that actually existed in the past but is now extinct)?",
    "Question 11: Is it a tree from mythology, religion, or fiction (rather than a scientifically documented tree)?",
    "Question 12: Did this tree exist during prehistoric times (before written human history)?",
    "Question 13: Did this tree exist during ancient human civilizations (approximately 3000 BCE to 500 CE)?",
    "Question 14: Did this tree exist during the medieval or pre-industrial era (approximately 500-1700 CE)?",
    "Question 15: Did this tree exist during the industrial era (approximately 1700-1900 CE)?",
    "Question 16: Did this tree exist during the modern era (post-1900 CE)?",
    "Question 17: Is this a hypothetical or conceptual tree that has been designed or proposed but never actually existed in nature?",
    "Question 18: Is this tree associated with a specific geological era or event (like the Ice Age or a particular evolutionary period)?",
    "Question 19: Is this tree something that exists (or existed) on a celestial body other than Earth (like another planet, moon, or in space)?",
    "Question 20: Based on the contradictory timeline information, I suspect there might be a special interpretation at play. Is this a tree in a non-botanical sense (like a family tree, decision tree, or other tree-like structure) despite being considered a physical plant?"

The Tree of Life is:\n- Physical in the sense that it represents real organisms\n- A \"tree\" but not in the literal botanical sense\n- Not found in any specific climate region\n- Doesn't exist in the present day in its complete form (as it's constantly evolving)\n- Could be considered \"maybe extinct\" as many branches have gone extinct\n- Not mythological or fictional (despite sharing a name with mythological concepts)\n- Not from any specific time period (spans all of evolutionary history)\n- Not associated with just one geological era\n\nI recognize this may not be correct, as the information suggests a physical botanical tree, but the timeline contradictions make a literal tree difficult to identify.",
