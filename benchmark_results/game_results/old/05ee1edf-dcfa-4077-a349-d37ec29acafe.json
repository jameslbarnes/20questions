    "Question 3: Is this physical object larger than a car?",

    "I notice there's a contradiction in the answers to Question 7. You initially answered \"No\" and then \"Yes\" to whether the electronic device is primarily used in the kitchen. I'll assume the correct answer is \"Yes\" since it was the last response.\n\nQuestion 8: Is this kitchen appliance used for cooking or heating food?",
    "Question 9: Is this kitchen appliance primarily used to cook or heat food on a flat surface?\nAnswer: No",
