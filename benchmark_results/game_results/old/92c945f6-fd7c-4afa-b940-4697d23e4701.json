    "Is it a physical, tangible object (something you can touch)?",
    "Is it something manufactured/made by humans (as opposed to occurring naturally)?",
    "Is it a living thing, or was it once living (like a fallen leaf or piece of wood)?",
    "Is it currently alive (as opposed to being dead/preserved/processed)?",
    "Is it from the plant kingdom (like a tree, flower, or other vegetation)?",
    "Is it something that grows from the ground (as opposed to floating/growing on other things like moss or algae)?",
    "Does it grow on other plants or trees (like a vine, moss, or fungus)?",
    "Does it get its nutrients by parasitically feeding off the host plant (rather than just using it for physical support)?",
    "Is it typically green in color?",
    "Given that it's a non-parasitic organism that grows on other plants, has an ambiguous living status, and variable color, I'm quite confident this is:\n\n<guess>Lichen</guess>",
    "(Incorrect guess: Lichen)",
    "Does it have long, trailing stems or vines that hang down or climb up?",
    "Is it a type of moss?",

    "Does it have distinct leaves or fronds (as opposed to being more stem-like or fungus-like in appearance)?",
    "Is it a type of fungus or mushroom?",
    "Since it's fungus-like in appearance, grows on trees, but isn't clustered, and has an ambiguous living status...\n\n<guess>A bracket fungus (shelf fungus)</guess>",
    "(Incorrect guess: A bracket fungus (shelf fungus))",
    "Is it something that forms or accumulates on trees over time, like tree sap or tree resin?",
    "Given it's from the plant kingdom, forms on trees, has an ambiguous living status, and isn't a distinct growing plant or fungus...\n\n<guess>Tree gall (a growth on a tree caused by insects or disease)</guess>"
