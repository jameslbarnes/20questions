    "Let me start with the most fundamental division.\n\nIs it a physical, tangible object (as opposed to an abstract concept, idea, or intangible thing)?",
    "Since it's not a physical object, we're dealing with something intangible - this could be a concept, idea, emotion, process, relationship, or abstract entity.\n\nQuestion 2: Is it something that humans experience or feel emotionally (like love, fear, happiness, etc.)?\n\nThis question helps divide the intangible space between emotional/experiential concepts and more abstract/intellectual concepts.",
    "Since it's intangible but not an emotion, let me further narrow the conceptual space.\n\nQuestion 3: Is it something that can be measured or quantified in some way (like time, speed, temperature, or mathematical concepts)?\n\nThis question helps separate measurable/scientific concepts from more abstract ideas like theories, beliefs, or cultural constructs.",
    "Let me analyze what we know:\n- It's intangible/not physical\n- It's not an emotion/feeling\n- It can be measured/quantified\n\nThis suggests we're dealing with some kind of mathematical, scientific, or measurable concept.\n\nQuestion 4: Is it a unit or measure of time (like a second, hour, year, etc.)?\n\nThis helps divide between time-related concepts and other measurable quantities (like distance, temperature, etc.)",
    "Let me analyze what we know:\n- It's intangible/not physical\n- It's not an emotion/feeling\n- It can be measured/quantified\n- It's not a unit/measure of time\n\nWe're still in the realm of measurable concepts, but have eliminated time. Let's narrow it further.\n\nQuestion 5: Is it related to space or distance (like length, width, height, area, volume, or distance itself)?\n\nThis helps divide between spatial measurements and other types of measurable quantities (like weight, temperature, speed, etc.)",
    "Let me analyze what we know:\n- It's intangible/not physical\n- It's not an emotion/feeling\n- It can be measured/quantified\n- It's not a unit/measure of time\n- It's not related to space/distance\n\nWe're still in the realm of measurable quantities, having eliminated time and space. Let's explore another major category of measurable concepts.\n\nQuestion 6: Is it related to quantity or number itself (like a specific number, mathematical operation, or counting concept)?\n\nThis helps separate numerical/mathematical concepts from other measurable quantities (like temperature, weight, speed, etc.)",
    "Let me analyze what we know:\n- It's intangible/not physical\n- It's not an emotion/feeling\n- It can be measured/quantified\n- It's not a unit/measure of time\n- It's not related to space/distance\n- It's not related to quantity/numbers\n\nWe've eliminated several major categories of measurable concepts (time, space, numbers), but are still dealing with something that can be measured. This suggests we might be dealing with physical properties or phenomena that can be measured.\n\nQuestion 7: Is it related to energy or force (like heat, electricity, speed, acceleration, or power)?\n\nThis helps separate energy/force-related concepts from other remaining measurable quantities (like weight, pressure, etc.)",

Major remaining categories include thermal energy, electrical energy, magnetic force, sound energy, or other forms of radiation.\n\nQuestion 9: Is it related to temperature or heat (thermal energy)?\n\nThis helps separate thermal concepts from other forms of energy/force (like electricity, magnetism, sound, etc.)",

    "Based on our process of elimination, I'm now extremely confident.\n\nWe've determined it's:\n- A form of electromagnetic radiation\n- Lower frequency than visible light\n- Not microwaves\n- Not radio waves\n- Not visible light\n- An intangible, measurable form of energy\n\nGiven all prior eliminations, this can only be infrared radiation (IR radiation/waves).",
    "(Incorrect guess: Infrared radiation)",
    "Let me carefully reassess. I must have made a wrong assumption somewhere. \n\nLet's verify something crucial:\n- We know it's electromagnetic radiation\n- Lower frequency than visible light\n- Not microwaves\n- Not radio waves\n- Not infrared\n\nQuestion 18: When you said it's related to light/electromagnetic radiation, is it perhaps a PROPERTY or CHARACTERISTIC of electromagnetic radiation (like wavelength, frequency, intensity, polarization) rather than a specific type of radiation itself?\n\nThis would explain why none of the specific types of radiation were correct, and opens up a new avenue of investigation.",
    "Let me verify my previous logic since my earlier guess of \"infrared radiation\" was indicated as incorrect, but then the follow-up seemed to confirm it was correct. This seems contradictory.\n\nQuestion 19: Just to be absolutely clear - is infrared radiation (IR radiation/waves) what you're thinking of?\n\nThis will help resolve the apparent contradiction in the previous answers and ensure we're on the right track.",
    "This is quite puzzling. Let me carefully review the key contradiction:\n\nAfter being told it wasn't infrared radiation (when I guessed), you then answered \"Yes\" to the next question. This suggests my initial guess of infrared radiation was actually correct, despite the \"that's not correct\" response.\n\nGiven this pattern and all our previous eliminations:\n- It's electromagnetic radiation\n- Lower frequency than visible light\n- Not microwaves\n- Not radio waves\n- Not visible light\n- All other possibilities have been eliminated\n- We got a contradictory response sequence about infrared"
