    "I'll start with a fundamental question to divide the possibilities:\n\nIs it a physical/tangible object?",
    "Question 2: Is it something that exists in reality (even as an abstract concept) rather than something purely fictional/imaginary?",
    "Question 3: Is it a concept or phenomenon that would exist even if humans didn't exist?",
    "Question 4: Is it a natural force or physical phenomenon (like gravity, electricity, light, or a natural process) rather than a purely abstract concept?",
    "Question 5: Is it a phenomenon that primarily occurs on Earth rather than a universal/cosmic phenomenon that occurs throughout space?",
    "Question 6: Is it one of the fundamental forces of physics (gravity, electromagnetism, strong nuclear force, or weak nuclear force)?",
    "Question 7: Is it a large-scale astronomical phenomenon (like a celestial body, space structure, or cosmic process) rather than a subatomic or quantum phenomenon?",
    "Question 8: Is it a discrete astronomical object (like a star, planet, black hole) rather than a process, radiation, or ongoing phenomenon?",
    "Question 9: Is it a form of energy, radiation, or light (like cosmic rays, gamma rays, cosmic microwave background) rather than a process or movement (like expansion of the universe or stellar evolution)?",
    "Question 10: Is it a process that involves the movement or motion of celestial bodies or structures (like orbital motion, galaxy rotation, or cosmic expansion) rather than a different type of astronomical process?",
    "Question 11: Is it related to a physical state or condition that exists in space (like temperature, pressure, density, or vacuum)?",
    "Question 12: Is it related to the structure, composition, or organization of the universe (like dark matter, the cosmic web, spacetime, or the fabric of the universe) rather than an event or occurrence?",
    "Question 13: Is it something that occupies or accounts for a significant portion of the universe's mass or energy (like dark matter or dark energy)?",
    "Question 14: Is it dark energy?",
    "Question 15: Is it dark matter?",
