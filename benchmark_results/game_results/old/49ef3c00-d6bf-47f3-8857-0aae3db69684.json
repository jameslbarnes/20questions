    "I'll help you play 20 Questions by asking strategic yes/no questions to identify the entity. Let me start with a broad question:\n\nIs the entity a physical object (as opposed to a concept, idea, or event)?",
    "I'll continue with more specific questions to narrow down this physical object.\n\nQuestion 2: Is this object something that would typically be found in a home?",
    "Thank you for the information. Let me continue with my questions.\n\nQuestion 3: Is this object primarily used in the kitchen?",
    "Thank you for the information so far. I know the entity is a physical object typically found in a home, but not primarily used in the kitchen.\n\nQuestion 4: Is this object primarily used for furniture purposes (sitting, sleeping, storage, etc.)?",
    "Thank you for the information. I'm learning that the entity is a physical object typically found in a home, used for furniture purposes, but not primarily used in the kitchen.\n\nQuestion 5: Is this piece of furniture primarily designed for sitting?\nAnswer:",
    "Question 6: Thank you for the clarification. Since this furniture is not primarily for sitting, let me continue narrowing it down.\n\nIs this piece of furniture primarily used for sleeping or resting on?",
    "Question 7: Thank you for the information. I know this is a piece of furniture found in homes that is not primarily for sitting, sleeping, or kitchen use.\n\nIs this piece of furniture primarily used for storage purposes?\nAnswer:",
    "Thank you for the information so far. I need to reconsider what type of furniture this might be since it's not primarily for sitting, sleeping, or storage.\n\nQuestion 8: Is this piece of furniture primarily used for working or studying (like a desk or workstation)?",
    "Thank you for the information so far. I'm learning that the entity is a piece of furniture found in homes, primarily used for working or studying, but not mainly for sitting, sleeping, or storage.\n\nQuestion 9: Is this furniture item typically made primarily of wood?",
    "Thank you for the information so far. I'm getting a clearer picture of this item.\n\nQuestion 10: Is this furniture item a desk?",
    "Thank you for the information so far. Let me think about this carefully. I know it's a wooden furniture item found in homes, used for working or studying, but it's not a desk.\n\nQuestion 11: Is this furniture item a bookshelf or bookcase?",
    "Question 12: Thank you for the additional information. I'm still trying to narrow down this wooden furniture item used for working or studying, but it's not a desk or bookshelf.\n\nIs this furniture item a drafting table or drawing board?",
    "Question 13: Thank you for the additional information. This is an interesting challenge. It's a wooden furniture item used for working or studying, but it's not a desk, bookshelf, or drafting table.\n\nIs this furniture item something that attaches to or sits on top of another piece of furniture (like a hutch or monitor stand)?",
    "Question 14: Thank you for the information so far. I'm continuing to narrow down this wooden furniture item used for working or studying.\n\nIs this furniture item a podium or lectern (something you might stand at to read or present)?",
    "Question 15: Thank you for your patience as I try to identify this furniture item. Let me explore another possibility.\n\nIs this furniture item primarily designed to hold or organize specific work/study materials (like an easel, filing cabinet, or music stand)?",
    "Question 16: Thank you for the information so far. Let me continue to narrow down this wooden furniture item used for working or studying.\n\nIs this furniture item primarily designed to support a computer or electronic equipment?",
    "Question 17: Thank you for the information so far. This is quite challenging! Let me think about what wooden furniture used for working/studying we haven't covered yet.\n\nIs this furniture item a writing desk or secretary desk (different from a standard desk, often with compartments and a fold-down writing surface)?\nAnswer:",
    "Question 18: Thank you for your patience as I continue to narrow this down. \n\nIs this furniture item typically placed in a home office or study room specifically (as opposed to being commonly found in other rooms like bedrooms or living rooms)?",
    "Thank you for the update on my remaining questions. Let me think more carefully about what this item might be.\n\nQuestion 19: Is this furniture item a standing desk or an adjustable height desk/table that allows a person to work while standing?",
    "Thank you for keeping track of our progress. I've been trying to identify a wooden furniture item found in homes that's used for working or studying but isn't a desk, bookshelf, drafting table, podium, secretary desk, standing desk, or something that attaches to another piece of furniture.\n\nQuestion 20: Is this furniture item a credenza (a low cabinet design that may be used for paperwork or as a working surface)?"
