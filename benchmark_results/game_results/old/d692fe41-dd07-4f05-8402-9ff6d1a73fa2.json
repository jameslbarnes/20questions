    "I'll play 20 Questions using an efficient strategy. Let me start with a fundamental question that divides the universe of possibilities:\n\nIs it a physical/tangible object?",
    "Question 2: Is it an abstract concept or idea (as opposed to a specific event, person, or place)?",
    "I'll continue with strategic questions to narrow down this abstract concept.\n\nQuestion 3: Is this abstract concept related to human emotions or feelings (like love, fear, happiness, etc.)?",
    "I'll continue narrowing down the abstract concept systematically.\n\nQuestion 4: Is this abstract concept related to science, mathematics, or academic disciplines?",
    "Question 5: Is this abstract concept related to mathematics specifically (as opposed to natural sciences, social sciences, or other academic disciplines)?",
    "Question 6: Is this abstract concept related to natural sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, astronomy, etc.) as opposed to social sciences or humanities?",
    "Question 7: Is this abstract concept related to social sciences (such as economics, psychology, sociology, anthropology, etc.)?",
    "Question 8: Is this abstract concept related to economics or financial systems (as opposed to psychology, sociology, anthropology, etc.)?",
    "Question 9: Is this abstract concept a fundamental economic mechanism or principle (like supply and demand, competition, markets, etc.) rather than a specific economic policy or financial instrument?",
    "Question 10: Is this abstract concept related to a specific financial instrument or asset (like stocks, bonds, currencies, etc.)?\nAnswer: Yes.",
    "Question 11: Is this abstract concept related to equity/ownership-based financial instruments (like stocks, shares, or ownership stakes) as opposed to debt-based instruments or other types of assets?",
    "Question 12: Is this abstract concept related to debt-based financial instruments (like bonds, loans, mortgages, etc.)?",
    "I need to refine my understanding of what type of financial instrument we're dealing with, since it's neither equity-based nor debt-based.\n\nQuestion 13: Is this abstract concept related to currencies or money itself (like fiat currency, cryptocurrency, or forex markets)?",
    "Question 14: Is this abstract concept a specific type of cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.) rather than traditional fiat currency or a broader monetary concept?",
    "I'll continue narrowing down this abstract concept related to currencies or money.\n\nQuestion 15: Is this abstract concept related to traditional fiat currency (government-issued money like dollars, euros, yen) rather than a broader monetary concept or system?",
    "Question 16: Is this abstract concept a broad monetary system or framework (like central banking, monetary policy, the gold standard, etc.) rather than a specific transaction mechanism?",
    "I need to further narrow down this financial concept that's related to currencies but isn't cryptocurrency, fiat currency, or a broad monetary system.\n\nQuestion 17: Is this abstract concept related to a specific financial transaction or payment mechanism (like wire transfers, credit cards, payment systems, etc.)?",
    "I need to reconsider the financial/currency domain from a different angle since I've eliminated many specific categories.\n\nQuestion 18: Is this abstract concept related to the properties or functions of money (like liquidity, store of value, medium of exchange, unit of account) rather than a specific form of money or system?",
    "I need to recalibrate my approach since I've eliminated many specific categories of financial instruments and monetary concepts.\n\nQuestion 19: Is this abstract concept related to financial markets or trading mechanisms (like stock exchanges, forex markets, futures markets, etc.)?",
    "I need to carefully consider what remains in the economic/financial domain that isn't a specific instrument, system, property of money, or market mechanism.\n\nQuestion 20: Is this abstract concept related to economic value measurement or wealth accounting (like GDP, net worth, inflation, purchasing power, etc.)?"

  "final_guess": "Money\n\nBased on our questioning path, I identified that the entity is:\n- An abstract concept (not physical)\n- Related to academic disciplines, specifically social sciences\n- Connected to economics and financial systems\n- Related to currencies or money\n- Not a specific type (not cryptocurrency, not fiat currency)\n- Not a broad monetary system or framework\n- Not a transaction mechanism\n- Not about money's properties/functions\n- Not about financial markets\n\nWhile I eliminated many specific aspects of money, the core concept of \"money\" itself remains consistent with all the answers received. It's an abstract economic concept related to currency that isn't any specific implementation or characteristic of money.",
