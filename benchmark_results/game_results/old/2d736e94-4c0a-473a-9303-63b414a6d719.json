    "Let me start with a broad question to narrow down the category:\n\nIs it a physical object (as opposed to a concept, place, or person)?",
    "Since it's not a physical object, I should determine which of the remaining categories it falls under.\n\nQuestion 2: Is it a person (either real or fictional)?\nAnswer: No.",
    "Thank you for the clarification that it IS a person.\n\nQuestion 3: Is this person currently alive?",
    "Question 4: Is this person a historical figure who died before 1900?\nThis will help me narrow down the time period.",
    "Let me continue narrowing down based on what I know:\n- It's a person (confirmed)\n- They are deceased\n- They died in 1900 or later\n\nQuestion 5: Was this person famous primarily for their contributions to arts/entertainment (as opposed to politics, science, sports, etc.)?\nThe answer will help me focus on a specific field of achievement.",
    "Let me analyze what I know:\n- It's a person who is deceased\n- They died after 1900\n- Not primarily known for arts/entertainment\n- These clues point toward someone in politics, science, business, or similar fields\n\nQuestion 6: Was this person primarily known for their role in politics or government?\n\nThis will help me determine if we're looking at a political figure versus other fields like science or business.",
    "Let me analyze what we know:\n- A deceased person who died after 1900\n- Not primarily known for arts/entertainment\n- Not primarily known for politics/government\n- This suggests possibly science, business, humanitarian work, or similar fields\n\nQuestion 7: Was this person primarily known for scientific or technological achievements?\n\nThis will help determine if we're dealing with a scientist/inventor versus other fields like business or humanitarian work.",
    "Let me analyze what we know:\n- A deceased scientist/technologist who died after 1900\n- Their primary recognition came from scientific/technological achievements\n\nQuestion 8: Did this person make significant contributions to physics or mathematics (as opposed to other scientific fields like biology, chemistry, etc.)?\n\nThis will help narrow down their field of scientific expertise.",
    "Let me analyze what we know:\n- A deceased physicist/mathematician who died after 1900\n- Made significant contributions to physics/mathematics\n- Not primarily known for arts, entertainment, or politics\n\nGiven these strong indicators, particularly in physics after 1900...\n\nQuestion 9: Was this person involved in the development of theories related to relativity or quantum mechanics?\n\nThis will help me determine if we're dealing with one of the major figures from early 20th century theoretical physics.",
    "Given what we know:\n- A physicist/mathematician who died after 1900\n- Made significant contributions to physics, particularly in relativity/quantum mechanics\n- The most famous person fitting this description would be Albert Einstein"
