    "I'll play 20 Questions by asking strategic yes/no questions to narrow down the possibilities efficiently.\n\nQuestion 1: Is it a physical, tangible object?",
    "I'll continue with strategic questions to narrow down the possibilities.\n\nQuestion 2: Is it a concept or idea (rather than a specific event, action, or entity)?\nAnswer:",
    "I'll keep narrowing down with strategic questions.\n\nQuestion 3: Is this concept related to human emotions or feelings?\nAnswer:",
    "I'll continue with strategic questions to narrow down the concept.\n\nQuestion 4: Is this concept related to a scientific or mathematical principle?",
    "I'll continue with strategic questions to narrow down this scientific or mathematical concept.\n\nQuestion 5: Is this concept used primarily in physics (rather than biology, chemistry, or other sciences)?\nAnswer:",
    "I'll continue narrowing down this physics concept systematically.\n\nQuestion 6: Is this concept related to the fundamental forces of nature (like gravity, electromagnetism, or nuclear forces)?\nAnswer:",
    "I'll continue narrowing down this physics concept related to fundamental forces.\n\nQuestion 7: Is this concept specifically related to gravity?\nAnswer:",
    "I'll continue narrowing down this gravity-related physics concept.\n\nQuestion 8: Is this concept related to Einstein's theory of general relativity?\nAnswer:",
    "I'll continue narrowing down this gravity-related concept from general relativity.\n\nQuestion 9: Is this concept related to the curvature of spacetime?\nAnswer:",
    "I'll continue narrowing down with strategic questions.\n\nQuestion 10: Is this concept specifically about a point in spacetime where gravity is so strong that not even light can escape (such as in a black hole)?\nAnswer:",
    "I'll continue narrowing down with strategic questions.\n\nQuestion 11: Is this concept related to how massive objects warp or bend spacetime around them?",
    "I'll continue narrowing down this physics concept about how massive objects warp spacetime.\n\nQuestion 12: Is this concept a specific term or principle rather than a general description of gravitational effects?",
    "Question 13: Is this concept the principle of equivalence (that gravitational acceleration is indistinguishable from acceleration due to other forces)?",
    "Question 14: Is this concept directly related to the mathematical representation or equations that describe how mass curves spacetime?",
    "Question 15: Is this concept the Einstein field equations that describe the fundamental interaction of gravitation as a result of spacetime being curved by mass and energy?",
    "Question 16: Is this concept the geodesic equation, which describes how objects move along the shortest path in curved spacetime?",
    "Question 17: Is this concept the gravitational time dilation (the effect where time passes more slowly in stronger gravitational fields)?",
    "Question 18: Is this concept related to a specific geometric or mathematical structure that represents how spacetime is curved by mass, such as the spacetime metric?",
    "I need to narrow down further with my remaining questions based on what I've learned. This is a physics concept related to gravity, general relativity, and how massive objects warp spacetime, but it's not the equivalence principle, Einstein field equations, geodesic equation, gravitational time dilation, or the spacetime metric.\n\nQuestion 19: Is this concept the principle of gravitational lensing (how light bends around massive objects due to curved spacetime)?",
    "Based on all the information gathered through my questions, I now have a clear understanding of the concept."
