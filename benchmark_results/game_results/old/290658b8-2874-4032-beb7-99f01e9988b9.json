    "I'll start with a fundamental question that divides the universe of possibilities:\n\nIs it a physical/tangible object?",
    "Question 2: Is it something created by humans (like a concept, idea, system, or digital entity) rather than something that would exist independently of human civilization?",
    "Question 3: Is it primarily digital or technological in nature (like software, a website, or an algorithm)?",
    "Question 4: Is it something that ordinary people directly interact with or use (like a specific app, website, or consumer service) rather than a technical infrastructure, protocol, or programming concept?",
    "Question 5: Is it primarily concerned with storing, transmitting, or organizing data (like a database system, network protocol, or file format) rather than processing, computing, or executing instructions?",
    "Question 6: Is it related to network communication or internet infrastructure (like a protocol, networking standard, or web technology) rather than purely local storage or processing systems?",
    "Question 7: Is it a fundamental internet protocol that operates at a lower level of the networking stack (like TCP/IP, DNS, BGP) rather than an application-level technology or service?",
    "Question 8: Is it a web technology standard, format, or protocol used specifically for organizing or exchanging data between systems (like HTTP, HTML, XML, JSON, REST, GraphQL) rather than a physical network infrastructure or security technology?",
    "Question 9: Is it related to network security, privacy, or encryption (like VPN technology, firewall systems, cryptographic protocols, or secure communication methods)?",
    "Question 10: Is it a specific encryption protocol or cryptographic standard (like SSL/TLS, SSH, PGP, AES, RSA) rather than a broader security system, technology or service?",
    "Question 11: Is it a network security system or technology designed primarily to monitor, filter, or control traffic (like firewalls, intrusion detection systems, or proxy servers) rather than a service, methodology, or broader concept?",
    "Question 12: Is it a security service, methodology, or framework (like Zero Trust, Identity and Access Management, Security as a Service) rather than a specific technology implementation or tool?",
    "Question 13: Is it a specific network security hardware or physical security component (like a hardware security module, security token, secure enclave, or specialized security device) rather than a purely software-based solution?",
    "Question 14: Is it related to secure identity management, authentication, or digital certificates (like PKI infrastructure, digital signatures, OAuth, SAML, or credential management systems) rather than network monitoring or threat detection?",
    "Question 15: Is it a specific authentication protocol or framework for managing user identity and access (like OAuth, SAML, OpenID, Kerberos) rather than a system for managing digital certificates or encryption keys?",
    "Question 16: Is it related to Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), Certificate Authorities (CAs), or the management/distribution of digital certificates rather than specific authentication credentials or user identity verification?",
    "Question 17: Is it related to password management, credential storage, or secure secret storage (like password managers, secure vaults, or systems for storing and retrieving sensitive authentication credentials) rather than identity verification methods?",
    "Question 18: Is it related to biometric authentication or digital identity verification methods (like fingerprint scanning, facial recognition, voice verification, or other systems that verify identity based on physical or behavioral characteristics)?",
    "Question 19: Is it a specific token-based security technology or key exchange method (like JWT, FIDO/WebAuthn, SSH keys, one-time tokens, or hardware tokens) used for secure authentication or identity verification?",
    "Question 20: Is it related to distributed or decentralized security systems (like blockchain security technology, distributed ledger for identity, peer-to-peer security protocols, or zero-knowledge proof systems) rather than centralized security mechanisms?"

  "final_guess": "Blockchain technology for identity management (or Self-Sovereign Identity)\n\nBased on our progression of questions, I've determined this is something:\n- Non-physical and created by humans\n- Digital/technological in nature\n- Not directly used by ordinary people (more infrastructure-level)\n- Focused on storing/transmitting/organizing data\n- Related to network communication\n- Connected to security and authentication\n- Specifically uses distributed/decentralized systems\n\nThis points to blockchain technology applied to identity management (sometimes called Self-Sovereign Identity or SSI), which uses distributed ledger technology to give individuals control over their digital identities without centralized authorities.",
