    "I'll start with a fundamental division that helps split the universe of possibilities.\n\nQuestion 1: Is it a physical, tangible object (something you can touch)?",
    "Let me think strategically about this. We know it's a physical, tangible object, which eliminates abstract concepts, ideas, and digital/virtual things. Now I need to further divide the remaining possibilities efficiently.\n\nQuestion 2: Is it something that was manufactured/made by humans (as opposed to occurring naturally)?\n\nThis question helps divide between natural objects (like rocks, trees, animal parts) and human-made objects (like tools, furniture, devices), which is a fundamental split for physical objects.",
    "Let's analyze what we know:\n1. It's a physical, tangible object\n2. It's manufactured/made by humans\n\nThis tells us we're dealing with a human-made item, but that's still a huge category. Let's try to divide this efficiently.\n\nQuestion 3: Is it primarily used inside buildings/homes (as opposed to primarily outdoors)?\n\nThis question helps split between indoor items (furniture, appliances, household goods) and outdoor items (vehicles, garden tools, outdoor equipment), which is a significant division of manufactured objects.",
    "Let's analyze what we know:\n1. Physical, tangible object\n2. Manufactured by humans\n3. Primarily used inside buildings/homes\n\nThis narrows us to indoor manufactured items, but that's still a broad category. Let's divide this further by function.\n\nQuestion 4: Is it used for practical purposes (as opposed to being primarily decorative)?\n\nThis helps split between functional items (furniture, appliances, tools) and decorative items (artwork, ornaments, decorations), which is a key division for indoor objects.",
    "Let's analyze what we know:\n1. Physical, tangible object\n2. Manufactured by humans\n3. Primarily used inside buildings/homes\n4. Used for practical purposes (not primarily decorative)\n\nWe're dealing with a functional indoor item. Let's further narrow this down by separating electrical from non-electrical items, as this is a major division of indoor practical objects.\n\nQuestion 5: Does it use or require electricity to function?\n\nThis splits between electrical items (appliances, electronics, lights) and non-electrical items (furniture, manual tools, kitchenware), which is a fundamental division of practical indoor objects.",
    "Let's analyze what we know:\n1. Physical, tangible object\n2. Manufactured by humans\n3. Primarily used inside buildings/homes\n4. Used for practical purposes (not decorative)\n5. Does NOT use electricity\n\nThis narrows us to non-electrical, practical indoor items. This could include furniture, manual tools, kitchenware, cleaning supplies, etc. Let's make another efficient split.\n\nQuestion 6: Is it something that's typically used while seated or from a seated position?\n\nThis helps divide between furniture/desk items versus items you typically use while standing/moving (like cleaning supplies, most kitchenware, etc.), which is a useful split for non-electrical indoor practical items.",
    "Let's analyze what we know:\n1. Physical, tangible object\n2. Manufactured by humans\n3. Primarily used inside buildings/homes\n4. Used for practical purposes (not decorative)\n5. Does NOT use electricity\n6. Typically used while seated/from seated position\n\nThis strongly suggests we're dealing with either:\n- Furniture itself (chairs, desks, tables)\n- Items commonly used at a desk/table (writing implements, books, desk accessories)\n- Items used while seated for specific activities (craft supplies, board games, etc.)\n\nLet's narrow this down further.\n\nQuestion 7: Is it a piece of furniture itself (rather than something that rests on/is used with furniture)?\n\nThis helps distinguish between the furniture itself versus items that are used while seated at furniture, which is a key division given our current knowledge.",

Does NOT use electricity\n6. Typically used while seated/from seated position\n7. NOT furniture itself, but something used with furniture\n\nThis strongly suggests we're dealing with an item that's used while seated at a desk/table. Let's further narrow this down.\n\nQuestion 8: Is it something commonly used for writing, drawing, or marking?\n\nThis helps divide between writing/drawing implements versus other desk items (like books, organizers, craft supplies, etc.), which is a significant split for items used while seated at furniture.",

Does NOT use electricity\n6. Typically used while seated/from seated position\n7. NOT furniture itself, but something used with furniture\n8. NOT used for writing/drawing/marking\n\nThis suggests we're dealing with an item used while seated that isn't writing-related. This could include:\n- Books/reading materials\n- Board games/puzzles\n- Eating/dining implements\n- Craft supplies\n- Desktop organizers/storage\n\nLet's make an efficient split of these remaining possibilities.\n\nQuestion 9: Is it something used for entertainment or leisure activities (as opposed to work, eating, or organizing)?\n\nThis helps divide between recreational items (games, puzzles, hobby items) versus utilitarian items used while seated (eating utensils, desktop organizers, etc.).",

Used for entertainment/leisure activities\n\nThis strongly suggests we're dealing with some kind of non-electronic game, puzzle, or hobby item that's used while seated. Let's narrow this down further.\n\nQuestion 10: Is it something that multiple people typically use/play with together (as opposed to being primarily for solo use)?\n\nThis helps divide between multiplayer games/activities versus solo activities like puzzles or individual hobby items, which is a key split for entertainment items used while seated.",

Used for entertainment/leisure activities\n10. Primarily for solo use (not multiple people)\n\nThis strongly suggests we're dealing with some kind of solo entertainment/hobby item used while seated. The main candidates at this point would be:\n- Jigsaw puzzles\n- Solo card games/solitaire\n- Individual hobby/craft items\n- Single-player tabletop games\n- Books/reading materials\n\nQuestion 11: Is it something that comes in multiple pieces or parts that you manipulate or arrange?\n\nThis helps distinguish between single-unit items (like books) versus items with multiple pieces (like puzzles, building sets, etc.), which is a key division for solo entertainment items.",

Used for entertainment/leisure activities\n10. Primarily for solo use (not multiple people)\n11. Does NOT come in multiple pieces/parts\n\nThis significantly narrows our possibilities. We're looking for a single-unit item used for solo entertainment while seated. Given that it's not multi-piece and not writing-related, this strongly suggests we're dealing with some kind of reading material or similar single-unit entertainment item.\n\nQuestion 12: Is it a book?\n\nThis direct question seems warranted given our accumulated knowledge points strongly toward this conclusion. If it's not a book, the answer will help us pivot to other single-unit entertainment items.\nAnswer: Yes."
