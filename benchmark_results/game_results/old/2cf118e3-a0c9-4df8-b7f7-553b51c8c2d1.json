    "Question 2: Is this object larger than a microwave oven?",
    "I need to be more precise with my size comparisons and gather more fundamental information.\n\nQuestion 3: Is this object something typically found in households?",

    "Question 5: Is this object primarily used for communication or entertainment (like a phone, TV, computer)?",

    "I'm making good progress! This is a physical household object used for comfort or rest, specifically designed for a single person to sit on.\n\nQuestion 10: Does this object have a back rest (as opposed to something like a stool or ottoman)?",
    "I've narrowed down that this is a single-person seat with a back rest found in homes. Let me refine further.\n\nQuestion 11: Does this seating object have armrests?",
    "I'll continue narrowing down with more specific questions about this single-person seat with a backrest.\n\nQuestion 12: Is this seating object primarily made of wood?",
    "I need to ask more specific questions about the type of single-person seat since the material composition seems uncertain.\n\nQuestion 13: Is this object primarily used in a living room or common area (as opposed to a bedroom, office, or specialized room)?",
    "I need to focus on more definitive characteristics since some of my recent questions couldn't be answered.\n\nQuestion 14: Would this single-person seat with a backrest be considered a regular chair (as opposed to a specialized type of seating like a recliner, rocking chair, or gaming chair)?"
