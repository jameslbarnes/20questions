    "# 20 Questions Game\n\nI'll try to figure out what you're thinking of through yes/no questions. Let me start with a fundamental question:\n\nQuestion 1: Is it a physical/tangible object?",
    "Question 2: Is it natural (not human-made)?",
    "Question 3: Is it living/organic (or was once living)?\nAnswer: Yes.",
    "Question 4: Is it currently alive (as opposed to something that was once living but is no longer)?",
    "Question 5: Is it an animal (as opposed to a plant, fungus, or microorganism)?",
    "Question 6: Is it a plant (as opposed to a fungus or microorganism)?",
    "Question 7: Is it a tree (woody plant with a single stem/trunk growing to a considerable height)?",
    "Question 8: Is it a relatively small plant (less than 1 meter/3 feet tall when mature)?",
    "Question 9: Is it a plant with a woody structure (like a shrub or bush, as opposed to herbaceous plants with soft stems)?",
    "Question 10: Does this plant produce parts that humans commonly eat or use for food?",
    "Question 11: Is this plant primarily grown/cultivated for its fruit (as opposed to leaves, seeds, stems, or roots)?",
    "Question 12: Does this plant grow as a vine or climbing structure (as opposed to standing upright on its own)?",
    "Question 13: Is this plant typically grown in tropical or subtropical climates?",
    "Question 14: Is the fruit of this plant typically red when ripe?",
    "Question 15: Is the fruit of this plant relatively small (smaller than a tennis ball)?",
    "Question 16: Is this plant annual (completes its life cycle in one growing season)?",
    "Question 17: Is this plant commonly grown in home vegetable gardens?",
    "Question 18: Is this plant grown for some type of berry (small, pulpy fruits without stones/pits)?",
    "Question 19: Is the fruit of this plant commonly used in cooking or processing (as opposed to primarily being eaten fresh)?",
    "Since I have only one question left, I should make it count by focusing on a specific possibility.\n\nQuestion 20: Is this plant an apple tree or closely related to apple trees in the Malus genus?"
