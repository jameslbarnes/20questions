    "I'll play 20 Questions, using a strategic approach to narrow down the possibilities.\n\nQuestion 1: Is it a physical, tangible object?",
    "I'll continue with strategic questions to narrow down the possibilities.\n\nQuestion 2: Is it a concept or idea (as opposed to a specific event, action, or emotion)?\n \nThe first answer established it's not a physical object, so now I'm trying to determine whether we're dealing with an abstract concept, or something else intangible like an event, feeling, or action.",
    "I'm making progress in narrowing down the possibilities. Since I now know it's a concept or idea rather than a physical object, I'll continue to refine the category.\n\nQuestion 3: Is this concept related to human society or social systems (as opposed to being a scientific, mathematical, or philosophical concept)?",
    "I'm building a mental model based on what I know so far:\n- Not a physical object\n- Is a concept or idea\n- Not related to human society or social systems (so likely a scientific, mathematical, or philosophical concept)\n\nQuestion 4: Is this concept related to mathematics or formal logic (as opposed to natural sciences or philosophy)?",
    "I'm building a mental model based on what I know so far:\n- Not a physical object\n- Is a concept or idea\n- Not related to human society or social systems\n- Not related to mathematics or formal logic\n- Likely in the realm of natural sciences or philosophy\n\nQuestion 5: Is this concept related to the natural sciences (biology, physics, chemistry, astronomy, etc.)?",
