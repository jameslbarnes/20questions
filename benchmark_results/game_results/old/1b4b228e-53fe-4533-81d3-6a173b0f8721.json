    "# 20 Questions Game\n\nI'll start with a foundational question that helps divide the universe of possibilities:\n\nIs it a physical/tangible object?",
    "Question 2: Is it human-made (manufactured/created by people)?",
    "Question 3: Is it small enough to hold in one hand?",
    "Question 4: Is it something typically found indoors?",
    "Question 5: Is it something typically used for transportation?",
    "Question 6: Is it a vehicle designed to transport multiple people at once?",
    "Question 7: Is it a land-based transportation vehicle (as opposed to air or water transport)?",
    "Question 8: Is it a vehicle primarily used for public or commercial transportation (like a bus, train, or commercial truck) rather than personal transportation?",
    "Question 9: Is it a standard passenger car (sedan, hatchback, or coupe) as opposed to a larger vehicle like an SUV, minivan, or truck?",
    "Question 10: Is this a specific make and model of car (like a Toyota Camry or Honda Civic) rather than the general category of \"car\"?",
    "Question 11: Is it specifically a sedan (as opposed to a hatchback or coupe)?",
    "Question 12: Is it a hatchback (a car with a rear door that opens upward to access a cargo area)?",
    "Question 13: Is it a coupe (a 2-door passenger car with a fixed roof)?",
    "Question 14: Is it a convertible (a car with a retractable or removable roof)?",
    "Question 15: Is it a station wagon/estate car (characterized by an extended roof and rear cargo area with a tailgate)?",
    "Question 16: Is it a specific type of car defined by its purpose or performance (such as a sports car, race car, or luxury car) rather than just its body style?",
    "Question 17: Is it the general concept of a \"car\" or \"automobile\" itself, rather than a specific type or style of passenger vehicle?",
