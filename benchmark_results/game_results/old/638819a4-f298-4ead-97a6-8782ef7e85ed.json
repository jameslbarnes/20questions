    "# 20 Questions Game\n\nI'll try to guess what you're thinking of through strategic yes/no questions.\n\nQuestion 1: Is it a physical/tangible object?",
    "Question 2: Is it a natural object (as opposed to man-made)?",
    "Question 3: Is it a living thing or part of a currently living organism?",
    "Question 4: Is it found naturally on Earth (as opposed to primarily in space)?",
    "Question 5: Is it solid at room temperature (as opposed to liquid or gas)?",
    "Question 6: Is it a liquid at room temperature (as opposed to a gas)?",
    "Question 7: Is it a gas at room temperature (since it's not solid or liquid)?",
    "Question 8: Is it one of the main components of Earth's atmosphere (like oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, etc.)?",
    "Question 9: Is it a noble gas (like helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, or radon)?",
    "Question 10: Is it a flammable gas?",
    "Question 11: Is it a gas that contains elements other than carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen (such as sulfur, chlorine, etc.)?",
    "Question 12: Does the gas contain carbon atoms in its molecular structure?",
    "Question 13: Does the gas contain hydrogen atoms in its molecular structure?",
    "Question 14: Does the gas contain nitrogen atoms in its molecular structure?",
    "Question 15: Does the gas contain oxygen atoms in its molecular structure?",
    "I'm quite puzzled by what I've learned so far. I've ruled out many gas categories, yet it's a natural gas found on Earth.\n\nQuestion 16: Is it a pure elemental gas (consisting of just one element in its natural state)?",
    "Question 17: I need to resolve some apparent contradictions in my understanding. Previously you indicated the gas doesn't contain carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, or oxygen, yet also doesn't contain elements outside those four, and isn't a pure element. \n\nIs it actually a mixture of gases rather than a single gas compound?",
    "Question 18: Is what you're thinking of actually a natural atmospheric phenomenon rather than a specific chemical gas (like fog, steam, clouds, or mist)?",
    "Question 19: Is this atmospheric phenomenon primarily composed of or related to water (like fog, clouds, mist, or steam)?",
    "Question 20: Is it an electrical atmospheric phenomenon (like lightning, aurora borealis, St. Elmo's fire, or similar electrical atmospheric events)?"

  "final_guess": "Wind\n\nThe entity appears to be a natural atmospheric phenomenon that's gaseous but isn't a specific chemical compound. It's not primarily water-related (ruling out fog, clouds, steam) and not electrical (ruling out lightning, aurora). After eliminating these possibilities and considering what natural gaseous phenomena exist on Earth, wind seems to be the most likely answer - it's the natural movement of air that surrounds us, fitting all the criteria established through my questions.",
