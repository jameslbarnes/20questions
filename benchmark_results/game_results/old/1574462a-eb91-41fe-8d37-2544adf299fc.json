I should try to split the remaining possibilities in half. Let me think about a good question that would achieve this.\n\nI could ask if it's something that exists in reality (even if intangible) versus something fictional or imaginary. This would separate real concepts (like love, democracy, mathematics) from fictional concepts (like unicorns, the Force from Star Wars, etc.)\n\nOr I could ask if it's something that has a specific definition or boundary (like a specific emotion, or a specific system) versus something more general or abstract (like an idea or concept).\n\nI think I'll go with asking if it's something that exists in reality versus fiction, as this seems like it would divide the space well."

Some possibilities include:\n- Emotions or feelings (love, fear, happiness)\n- Mental concepts or ideas (democracy, justice)\n- Time-related concepts (a day, a year, time itself)\n- Mathematical concepts (numbers, equations)\n- Processes or phenomena (inflation, evolution)\n- Relationships (friendship, kinship)\n- Systems or structures (the internet, the legal system)\n- Events (a birthday, election)\n\nA good division would be asking if it's something fundamentally human-created or if it would exist regardless of humans:\n\n- Human-created: languages, legal systems, economic systems, computer programs, music, art forms\n- Not human-created: natural laws, time, mathematical truths, natural phenomena\n\nThis seems like a good next question to roughly divide the possibilities."

I could ask:\n\n1. Is it something primarily intellectual/cognitive (like a concept, theory, idea) vs something more social/cultural/emotional?\n2. Is it something that has a formal structure or definition (like a system, language, discipline) vs something more informal?\n3.
