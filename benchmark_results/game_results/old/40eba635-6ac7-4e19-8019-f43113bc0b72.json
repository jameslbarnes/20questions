    "# 20 Questions Game\n\nI'll start with a fundamental question that divides the universe of possibilities:\n\nIs it something physical/tangible (something you can touch)?",
    "Question 2: Is it something man-made (created or manufactured by humans rather than occurring naturally)?",
    "Question 3: Is it something alive or organic (currently or was once part of a living organism)?",
    "Question 4: Is it currently alive (as opposed to being a product or material derived from something once living)?",
    "Question 5: Is it an animal (as opposed to a plant, fungus, or microorganism)?",
    "Question 6: Is it a plant (as opposed to a fungus, bacterium, or other type of organism)?",
    "Question 7: Is it commonly kept indoors as a houseplant?",
    "Question 8: Is it a plant that is deliberately grown or cultivated by humans for agricultural purposes (like food, fiber, or other commercial uses)?",
    "Question 9: Is it a plant that is primarily grown for human food consumption (as opposed to being grown for fiber, fuel, ornamental purposes, or animal feed)?",
    "Question 10: Is it a fruit-bearing plant (a plant that produces fruits that humans eat)?",
    "Question 11: Is it a tree (as opposed to a vine, bush, or smaller plant)?",
    "Question 12: Is it a tree that primarily grows in tropical or subtropical climates (as opposed to temperate or cold climates)?",
    "Question 13: Is it a tree that produces one of the more common orchard fruits found in temperate regions (such as apples, pears, peaches, cherries, or plums)?",
    "Question 14: Does this tree produce fruits with an edible skin that people typically eat without peeling (like apples, cherries, or plums, as opposed to peaches or pears which are sometimes peeled)?",
    "Question 15: Does this tree produce fruits that are relatively small (smaller than a typical apple), such as cherries or plums?",
    "Question 16: Does this tree produce fruits that are typically round or round-ish and come in varieties of red, green, or yellow colors?",
    "Question 17: Is the fruit you're thinking of an apple (or an apple tree)?"
