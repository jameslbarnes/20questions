    "Based on the information so far, we know that the entity is a man-made object found in a household, it is a type of tool or instrument, and it is not used for entertainment, office, transportation, cooking, cleaning, personal care, comfort, storage, communication, decoration, repairs, crafting, measuring, or gardening. \n\nIt sounds like a household tool that doesn't fit into any of these categories. It's not electronic, so that rules out many household items.\n\nFor my final question, I'll narrow it down further:\n\nIs the entity you're thinking of used in a household for safety or security purposes?"
