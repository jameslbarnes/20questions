It describes a quantum phenomenon where pairs or groups of particles are generated, interact, or share spatial proximity in a way such that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently of the state of the others. It's a key concept in quantum mechanics and quantum information science.\n\nIt is heavily studied in academic settings and is a fundamental concept in quantum physics. It was first discussed by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen in their famous EPR paradox paper, and later developed by many scientists including Schr\u00f6dinger (who coined the term \"entanglement\").\n\nSo the answer is clearly \"yes\" - quantum entanglement is an academic/scientific concept."

Quantum mechanics in general relies heavily on mathematical tools like linear algebra, complex vector spaces (Hilbert spaces), probability theory, and operators. Quantum entanglement specifically involves mathematical concepts like tensor products of Hilbert spaces.\n\nAs for logic, quantum entanglement and quantum mechanics more broadly have connections to quantum logic, which is different from classical logic. Quantum phenomena sometimes challenge classical logical expectations, leading to the development of different logical frameworks.\n\nSo quantum entanglement is definitely related to mathematics, as mathematics is used to describe and understand it. It also has some connection to logic, particularly in how it challenges classical logical intuitions.\n\nGiven these considerations, the answer is yes - quantum entanglement is related to mathematics and logic, especially mathematics."
