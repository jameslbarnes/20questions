    "I'll start with the most fundamental division possible.\n\nIs it something physical/tangible (as opposed to an abstract concept, idea, or intangible thing)?",
    "Since it's physical/tangible, let's determine if it's naturally occurring or human-made.\n\nQuestion 2: Is it something manufactured/made by humans (as opposed to occurring naturally)?\n\nThis question helps divide the physical world between natural objects (like rocks, trees, animals) and artificial objects (like tools, buildings, devices).",
    "Let's establish if it's alive or not.\n\nQuestion 3: Is it something that is alive/organic (as opposed to non-living like rocks or water)?\n\nThis will help divide the natural world between living things (plants, animals, fungi, etc.) and non-living natural objects (minerals, water bodies, celestial objects, etc.).",
    "Let me analyze what we know:\n- It's physical/tangible\n- It's natural (not human-made)\n- It's alive/organic\n\nThis points to something from the natural world that's living - could be an animal, plant, fungus, or other organism.\n\nQuestion 4: Is it an animal (member of the kingdom Animalia, as opposed to plants, fungi, or other living things)?\n\nThis will help narrow down which major category of living things we're dealing with, splitting between animals and other forms of life.",
    "Let me analyze what we know:\n- Physical/tangible\n- Natural (not human-made)\n- Alive/organic\n- Is an animal\n\nLet's divide the animal kingdom by size category to efficiently narrow down our search.\n\nQuestion 5: Is it larger than a typical house cat when fully grown?\n\nThis question helps divide animals into rough size categories - larger animals (like horses, elephants, bears) vs smaller animals (like cats, rabbits, squirrels, and smaller).",
    "Let me analyze what we know:\n- Physical/tangible\n- Natural (not human-made)\n- Alive/organic\n- Is an animal\n- Is smaller than or about the size of a house cat\n\nLet's divide this category of small animals between vertebrates and invertebrates, as this is a major biological division that will eliminate many possibilities.\n\nQuestion 6: Is it a vertebrate (does it have a backbone/spine - like mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, amphibians - as opposed to insects, spiders, worms, etc.)?\n\nThis question will help determine if we're dealing with a small vertebrate animal or an invertebrate.",
    "Let me analyze what we know:\n- Physical/tangible\n- Natural (not human-made)\n- Alive/organic\n- Is an animal\n- Is smaller than or about the size of a house cat\n- Is a vertebrate (has a backbone)\n\nNow we can efficiently divide the remaining possibilities by major vertebrate classes.\n\nQuestion 7: Is it a mammal (as opposed to birds, fish, reptiles, or amphibians)?\n\nThis question helps divide small vertebrates between mammals (mice, squirrels, hamsters) and other vertebrate classes (lizards, frogs, small birds, fish).",
    "Let me analyze what we know:\n- Physical/tangible\n- Natural (not human-made)\n- Alive/organic\n- Is an animal\n- Is smaller than or about the size of a house cat\n- Is a vertebrate (has a backbone)\n- Is a mammal\n\nWe're dealing with a small mammal. Let's divide the small mammals between those that commonly interact with humans and those that are primarily wild.\n\nQuestion 8: Is it commonly kept as a pet or domesticated (like hamsters, guinea pigs, gerbils) as opposed to primarily wild mammals (like squirrels, chipmunks, wild mice)?\n\nThis question helps separate domestic/pet small mammals from wild small mammals, which will significantly narrow our remaining possibilities.",
    "Let me analyze what we know:\n- Physical/tangible\n- Natural (not human-made)\n- Alive/organic\n- Is an animal\n- Is smaller than or about the size of a house cat\n- Is a vertebrate (has a backbone)\n- Is a mammal\n- Is commonly kept as a pet/domesticated\n\nWe're dealing with a small pet mammal. The most common small pet mammals are hamsters, guinea pigs, gerbils, rabbits, ferrets, and mice. Let's divide these efficiently by size.\n\nQuestion 9: Is it smaller than a guinea pig when fully grown?\n\nThis question helps separate the very small pet mammals (hamsters, gerbils, mice) from the medium-small pet mammals (guinea pigs, rabbits, ferrets), further narrowing our search space.",
    "Let me analyze what we know:\n- Physical/tangible\n- Natural (not human-made)\n- Alive/organic\n- Is an animal\n- Is smaller than or about the size of a house cat\n- Is a vertebrate (has a backbone)\n- Is a mammal\n- Is commonly kept as a pet/domesticated\n- Is NOT smaller than a guinea pig\n\nThis narrows our options considerably. The most common pet mammals that are about guinea pig size or larger (but still smaller than a cat) would be:\n- Guinea pigs\n- Rabbits\n- Ferrets\n\nLet's divide these efficiently.\n\nQuestion 10: Does it have long ears relative to its head size?\n\nThis question will help determine if it's a rabbit (which has distinctively long ears) versus other similarly-sized pet mammals like guinea pigs or ferrets.",
    "Let me analyze what we know:\n- Physical/tangible\n- Natural (not human-made)\n- Alive/organic\n- Is an animal\n- Is smaller than or about the size of a house cat\n- Is a vertebrate (has a backbone)\n- Is a mammal\n- Is commonly kept as a pet/domesticated\n- Is NOT smaller than a guinea pig\n- Does NOT have long ears\n\nThis has effectively eliminated rabbits, leaving us primarily with guinea pigs and ferrets as the most likely candidates among common pets of this size. The key distinction between these is body shape.\n\nQuestion 11: Does it have a long, slender body (as opposed to a rounder, stouter body shape)?\n\nThis question will help distinguish between ferrets (long and slender) and guinea pigs (round and stout).",
    "Let me analyze what we know:\n- Physical/tangible\n- Natural (not human-made)\n- Alive/organic\n- Is an animal\n- Is smaller than or about the size of a house cat\n- Is a vertebrate (has a backbone)\n- Is a mammal\n- Is commonly kept as a pet/domesticated\n- Is NOT smaller than a guinea pig\n- Does NOT have long ears\n- Does NOT have a long, slender body\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- We've eliminated rabbits (due to no long ears)\n- We've eliminated ferrets (due to no long, slender body)\n- We're looking for a stout-bodied pet mammal about guinea pig size\n- The answers strongly point to a guinea pig\n\nSince all the characteristics match and we've eliminated the other main possibilities in this category, I'm ready to make my guess.",
    "(Incorrect guess: Guinea pig)",
    "Let me reassess the situation. I made the assumption it was a guinea pig without actually confirming it with a guess. Let's continue questioning.\n\nLet me analyze what we know and what other possibilities might exist in this category. We're looking for:\n- A pet mammal about guinea pig size or larger (but smaller than a cat)\n- Not long-eared like a rabbit\n- Not long-bodied like a ferret\n- Stout/round bodied\n\nCould be other pet rodents or similar animals I haven't considered.\n\nQuestion 13: Is it a rodent (like guinea pigs, rats, chinchillas) as opposed to other types of mammals?\n\nThis will help confirm if we're in the right family of mammals or if we need to consider other possibilities.",
    "Let me carefully reassess what we know, as I must have made an incorrect assumption somewhere:\n- Physical/tangible\n- Natural (not human-made)\n- Alive/organic\n- Is an animal\n- Is smaller than or about the size of a house cat\n- Is a vertebrate (has a backbone)\n- Is a mammal\n- Is commonly kept as a pet/domesticated\n- Is NOT smaller than a guinea pig\n- Does NOT have long ears\n- Does NOT have a long, slender body\n\nI need to explore other possibilities I might have overlooked. Let's check if it's a rodent, as this will help distinguish between different families of small pets.\n\nQuestion 14: Is it a rodent (like guinea pigs, hamsters, rats - characterized by continuously growing front teeth) as opposed to other types of mammals?\n\nThis will help determine if I need to consider other families of small pet mammals that I might have overlooked.",
    "Let me analyze what we know:\n- Physical/tangible\n- Natural (not human-made)\n- Alive/organic\n- Is an animal\n- Is smaller than or about the size of a house cat\n- Is a vertebrate (has a backbone)\n- Is a mammal\n- Is commonly kept as a pet/domesticated\n- Is NOT smaller than a guinea pig\n- Does NOT have long ears\n- Does NOT have a long, slender body\n- Is NOT a rodent\n\nThis is a significant revelation - it's not a rodent, which eliminates guinea pigs, chinchillas, etc. Given all these characteristics, we might be dealing with a different order of mammals altogether.\n\nQuestion 15: Is it from the order Carnivora (meat-eating mammals like cats, dogs, etc., even if domesticated)?\n\nThis will help determine if we're dealing with a small carnivorous mammal that's commonly kept as a pet, as opposed to other orders of mammals.",
    "Let me carefully analyze the situation as we seem to have contradictory information:\n- In Question 13, we asked if it was a rodent and got \"No\"\n- In Question 14, we asked essentially the same question and got \"Yes\"\n\nLet's trust the most recent answer (Yes, it is a rodent) and continue from there.\n\nWhat we know:\n- It's a rodent\n- About guinea pig size or larger (but smaller than a cat)\n- Not long-eared\n- Not long-bodied\n- Commonly kept as a pet\n- Has a stout/round body\n\nCommon pet rodents fitting these criteria that we haven't specifically eliminated could include:\n- Chinchillas\n- Large fancy rats\n- Degus\n- Short-tailed gerbils\n\nQuestion 15: Does it have particularly soft, dense fur that's known for being very thick and plush?\n\nThis question will help identify if it's a chinchilla (known for their exceptionally soft, dense fur) versus other rodents with more standard fur.",
    "Let me carefully analyze the situation, as there seems to be some confusion or contradiction in the answers:\n\nPrevious answers indicated:\n- NOT a rodent in Q13\n- BUT IS a rodent in Q14\n- NOT from order Carnivora\n- About guinea pig size or larger (but smaller than cat)\n- Commonly kept as pet\n- Round/stout bodied\n- No long ears\n\nGiven the conflicting answers about whether it's a rodent, let me ask a question that approaches from a different angle to clarify our possibilities.\n\nQuestion 16: Does it have fur (as opposed to being hairless)?\n\nThis might help eliminate some exotic pets and clarify what category we're dealing with, given the seemingly contradictory information about whether it's a rodent.",
    "Based on this analysis, I believe I can make a confident guess. Let's review the key characteristics that lead to my conclusion:\n\n- It's a rodent\n- About guinea pig size or larger (but smaller than a cat)\n- Not long-eared\n- Not long-bodied\n- Commonly kept as a pet\n- Has a stout/round body\n- Has particularly soft, dense, plush fur\n\nThese characteristics, especially the combination of being a rodent of that size with notably soft, dense fur, strongly point to one specific animal.",
    "(Incorrect guess: Chinchilla\n\nThe distinguishing feature of the particularly soft, dense fur is especially indicative of a chinchilla, as they are famous for having the densest, softest fur of any land mammal. This, combined with their size (larger than a guinea pig but smaller than a cat), round body shape, and status as a common pet rodent, makes chinchilla the most logical conclusion.)",
    "Given that my last attempt at analysis was met with \"That's not correct,\" let me focus on what we know with certainty from the consistent answers:\n\n- Physical/tangible\n- Natural (not human-made)\n- Alive/organic\n- Is an animal\n- Is smaller than a house cat\n- Is a vertebrate\n- Is a mammal\n- Is commonly kept as a pet\n- NOT smaller than a guinea pig\n- Does NOT have long ears\n- Does NOT have a long, slender body\n- Has particularly soft, dense fur\n\nGiven these characteristics, and especially the last answer about the soft, dense fur being a distinguishing feature, I'm ready to make a guess.",
    "(Incorrect guess: Chinchilla)",
    "Given that I only have one question left, and our previous question about the animal having particularly soft, dense fur was answered \"Yes\", combined with all our other confirmed characteristics:\n\n- It's a rodent\n- About guinea pig size or larger (but smaller than a cat)\n- Not long-eared\n- Not long-bodied\n- Commonly kept as a pet\n- Has a stout/round body\n- Has particularly soft, dense fur"
