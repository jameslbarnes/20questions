    "Let me start with a broad question to narrow down the category.\n\nIs it a physical object (something you can touch)?",
    "Let me try to narrow down the size category.\n\nQuestion 2: Can this object fit in the palm of a typical adult's hand?",
    "Let me try to determine if this is a piece of furniture or household item, since it's larger than hand-size.\n\nQuestion 3: Is this object commonly found inside homes?\nYour answer?",
    "Let me continue narrowing down the category of household items.\n\nQuestion 4: Is this object primarily used for sitting or lying down?",
    "Given the answers so far, I know it's:\n- A physical object\n- Larger than hand size\n- Commonly found in homes\n- Used for sitting or lying down\n\nThis strongly suggests it's a piece of furniture for seating or resting. Let me narrow it down further.\n\nQuestion 5: Is this object primarily used for sleeping (like a bed)?\nYour answer?",
    "Based on the answers so far, I know it's:\n- A physical object\n- Larger than hand size\n- Commonly found in homes\n- Used for sitting/lying down\n- Not primarily for sleeping\n\nThis strongly suggests it's some type of seating furniture like a chair, sofa, or recliner.\n\nQuestion 6: Is this object designed to seat more than one person?\nYour answer?",
    "Based on the answers so far, I know it's:\n- A physical object\n- Larger than hand size\n- Commonly found in homes\n- Used for sitting/lying down\n- Not primarily for sleeping\n- Designed for one person\n\nThis is pointing strongly toward a single-person chair of some kind. Let me narrow down the type.\n\nQuestion 7: Does this chair have any reclining or rocking functionality?",
    "Based on the answers so far, I know it's:\n- A physical object\n- Larger than hand size\n- Commonly found in homes\n- Used for sitting/lying down\n- Not primarily for sleeping\n- Designed for one person\n- No reclining/rocking functionality\n\nThis is pointing towards a basic chair. Let me confirm one more detail before making a guess.\n\nQuestion 8: Does this chair typically have cushioning or upholstery (as opposed to being made entirely of hard materials like wood or plastic)?",
    "Given that last answer was ambiguous, I need to narrow down the type of chair further.\n\nQuestion 9: Is this chair primarily associated with dining or eating (like a dining room chair)?\nPrevious answers I'm considering:\n- A physical object\n- Larger than hand size\n- Commonly found in homes\n- Used for sitting/lying down\n- Not primarily for sleeping\n- Designed for one person\n- No reclining/rocking functionality\n- Cushioning status unknown",
    "Let me think about this carefully. The \"I don't know\" answers about dining and cushioning suggest I need to focus on more definitive characteristics.\n\nQuestion 10: Does this chair have arms/armrests?\n\nThis should help distinguish between several common chair types.",
    "Looking at the pattern of \"I don't know\" answers for specific chair features, I should try a different approach. Instead of asking about specific features, let me ask about the chair's primary location or purpose.\n\nQuestion 11: Is this chair primarily used in a home office or desk workspace?\n\nPrevious definitive answers I'm considering:\n- A physical object\n- Larger than hand size\n- Commonly found in homes\n- Used for sitting/lying down\n- Not primarily for sleeping\n- Designed for one person\n- No reclining/rocking functionality",
    "The pattern of \"I don't know\" answers for specific chair types and features suggests I need to make my questions more basic and definitive. Let me try a different angle.\n\nQuestion 12: Is this chair primarily made of wood?\n\nThis should help determine the basic material composition, which might give me a better direction.",
    "The pattern of \"I don't know\" answers for specific materials, features, and uses is telling me that I might be too focused on the word \"chair\" when the entity could be any single-person seat. Let me broaden my approach.\n\nQuestion 13: Is this object considered a permanent or fixed part of the room it's in (like a built-in bench or window seat), rather than a movable piece of furniture?\n\nThis question should help determine if I need to think beyond conventional movable chairs.\n\nPrevious definitive answers I'm considering:\n- A physical object\n- Larger than hand size\n- Commonly found in homes\n- Used for sitting/lying down\n- Not primarily for sleeping\n- Designed for one person\n- No reclining/rocking functionality"
