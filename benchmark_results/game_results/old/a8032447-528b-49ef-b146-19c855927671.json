    "Let me start with a fundamental question that divides the universe of possibilities into two broad categories:\n\nIs it something physical/tangible (as opposed to an abstract concept, idea, or intangible thing)?",
    "Since we've established it's not physical/tangible, it's in the realm of abstract concepts, ideas, or intangible things. Let's further narrow this broad category.\n\nQuestion 2: Is it an emotion or feeling (like happiness, fear, love, etc.)?\n\nThis question helps divide the intangible world between emotional/psychological concepts and other abstract concepts (like mathematical concepts, theories, processes, etc.).",
    "Let me analyze what we know:\n- It's not physical/tangible\n- It's not an emotion/feeling\n- It's some kind of abstract concept/idea\n\nLet me continue dividing the remaining abstract concepts efficiently.\n\nQuestion 3: Is it something that can be measured or quantified (like time, speed, temperature, or mathematical concepts)?\n\nThis question helps separate measurable abstract concepts from more theoretical or philosophical ones.",
    "Let me analyze what we know:\n- It's not physical/tangible\n- It's not an emotion/feeling\n- It's not something measurable/quantifiable\n- It's some kind of abstract concept/idea\n\nWe're in the realm of theoretical, philosophical, or conceptual ideas that can't be measured. Let's further narrow this down.\n\nQuestion 4: Is it a human-created concept or system (like democracy, justice, language, or religion) as opposed to a natural phenomenon or universal principle?\n\nThis question helps separate human constructs from natural/universal abstract concepts.",
    "Let me analyze what we know:\n- It's not physical/tangible\n- It's not an emotion/feeling\n- It's not something measurable/quantifiable\n- It is a human-created concept/system\n- It's some kind of abstract concept/idea\n\nWe've narrowed it down to human-created abstract systems or concepts. Let's further refine this.\n\nQuestion 5: Is it related to how humans organize or govern themselves (like laws, political systems, economic systems, or social structures)?\n\nThis question helps separate societal/organizational concepts from other human-created concepts like art, philosophy, or communication systems.",
    "Let me analyze what we know:\n- It's not physical/tangible\n- It's not an emotion/feeling\n- It's not something measurable/quantifiable\n- It is a human-created concept/system\n- It's related to how humans organize/govern themselves\n- It's some kind of abstract concept/idea\n\nWe're in the domain of societal organization and governance. Let's narrow this further.\n\nQuestion 6: Is it specifically related to government or political systems (like democracy, monarchy, voting) as opposed to economic or social systems?\n\nThis question helps separate political concepts from other forms of societal organization.",
    "Let me analyze what we know:\n- It's not physical/tangible\n- It's not an emotion/feeling\n- It's not something measurable/quantifiable\n- It is a human-created concept/system\n- It's related to how humans organize/govern themselves\n- It's NOT specifically related to government/political systems\n- It's some kind of abstract concept/idea\n\nSince it's about human organization but not political systems, we're likely dealing with either economic systems or social systems/structures. Let's clarify this division.\n\nQuestion 7: Is it related to economic systems or concepts (like money, trade, markets, capitalism) as opposed to social structures/customs?\n\nThis question helps separate economic concepts from purely social ones.",

This could include things like social hierarchies, cultural practices, communication systems, or institutional structures.\n\nQuestion 8: Is it related to how humans communicate or share information (like language, education, or media systems) as opposed to other social structures/customs?\n\nThis question helps separate communication/information systems from other social structures.",

Let's narrow this further.\n\nQuestion 10: Is it a system that categorizes people based on their birth or inherited status (like caste systems or nobility) rather than acquired characteristics (like education level or profession)?\n\nThis helps separate inherited/birth-based social classifications from achieved/acquired ones.",
