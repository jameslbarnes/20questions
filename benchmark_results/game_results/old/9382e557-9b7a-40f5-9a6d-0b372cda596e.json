    "I'll start with a fundamental question that divides possibilities broadly:\n\nIs it something physical/tangible (as opposed to an abstract concept or idea)?",
    "Question 2: Is it a concept created by humans (as opposed to something that would exist regardless of human civilization, like a natural phenomenon or mathematical principle)?",
    "Question 3: Is this concept relatively modern (created within the last 200 years)?",
    "Question 4: Is this concept primarily related to technology or computing?",
    "Question 5: Is this concept directly related to the Internet or networked computing?",
    "Question 6: Is this concept related to the user-facing aspects of the internet (applications, services, content) rather than the underlying technical infrastructure (protocols, architecture)?",
    "Question 7: Is this concept a specific protocol or technical standard (like TCP/IP, HTTP, DNS) rather than a broader architectural concept?",
    "Question 8: Is this concept related to how data is transmitted, routed, or moved across networks (as opposed to how networks are organized or secured)?",
    "Question 9: Is this concept related to network security or privacy (as opposed to network organization or architecture)?",
    "Question 10: Is this concept related to the overall structure, organization, or architecture of networks (as opposed to network functions, operations, or services)?",
    "Question 11: Is this concept related to a specific way of organizing computers or network components (like client-server, peer-to-peer, or specific network topologies) as opposed to a broader paradigm or approach to networking?",
    "Question 12: Is this concept related to a hierarchical organization of network components (where some components are in control of or provide services to others) as opposed to a more decentralized or equal arrangement?",
    "Question 13: Is this concept related to a peer-to-peer (P2P) organization of network components (where nodes connect directly to each other without central servers)?",
    "Question 14: Is this concept primarily about enabling direct resource sharing (like files, processing power, or storage) between network participants?",
    "Question 15: Is this concept specifically related to decentralization or the distribution of control/authority across a network (as opposed to other aspects of P2P networks)?",
    "Question 16: Does this concept involve mechanisms for distributed consensus (ways for nodes in a decentralized network to agree on information without central authority)?",
    "Question 17: Is this concept specifically related to maintaining a secure, transparent record of transactions or information across a decentralized network (like blockchain or distributed ledger technology)?",
    "Question 18: Is this concept the general technology/paradigm of blockchain itself (rather than a specific implementation, application, or aspect of blockchain technology)?",
    "I've honed in on what appears to be blockchain technology. Let me use my remaining questions to be absolutely certain.\n\nQuestion 19: Is this concept specifically known as \"blockchain technology\" (as opposed to a different term describing similar distributed ledger concepts)?",
