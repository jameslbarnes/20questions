    "# 20 Questions Game\n\nI'll ask strategic yes/no questions to figure out what you're thinking of!\n\nMy first question: Is it a physical/tangible object?",
    "Question 2: Is it something created or defined by humans (as opposed to something that would exist regardless of human civilization)?",
    "Question 3: Is it a natural force, physical law, or phenomenon studied in physics (like gravity, electricity, magnetism, time, etc.)?",
    "Question 4: Is it one of the four fundamental forces of nature (gravity, electromagnetism, strong nuclear force, or weak nuclear force)?",
    "Question 5: Is it primarily a form of energy or a phenomenon related to energy transfer/transformation (like heat, light, sound, etc.)?",
    "Question 6: Is it related to matter or the properties/states of matter (like pressure, density, states of matter, etc.)?",
    "Question 7: Is it related to space, time, or spacetime (like the fabric of spacetime, time dilation, etc.)?",
    "Question 8: Is it a law or principle in physics (rather than an observable phenomenon)?",
    "Question 9: Is it a planetary or astronomical phenomenon (like eclipses, auroras, planetary motion, etc.)?",
    "Question 10: Is it a quantum phenomenon or related to quantum physics (like quantum entanglement, superposition, tunneling)?"
