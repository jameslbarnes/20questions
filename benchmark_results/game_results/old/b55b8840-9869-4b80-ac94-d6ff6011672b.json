    "I'll start with the most fundamental division possible.\n\nIs it a physical/tangible object (something you can touch)?",
    "Since it's not a physical object, I need to determine if it's a concept, action, feeling, idea, or some other intangible thing.\n\nQuestion 2: Is it an action or activity (something that can be done or performed)?\n\nThis question helps divide the intangible world between active processes/behaviors versus static concepts/ideas/feelings.",
    "Let me analyze what we know:\n- Not a physical/tangible object\n- Not an action/activity\n- Must be some kind of abstract concept, idea, feeling, or intangible state\n\nQuestion 3: Is it an emotion or feeling (like happiness, fear, love, etc.)?\n\nThis question helps separate emotional/psychological states from other abstract concepts.",
    "Let me analyze what we know:\n- Not physical/tangible\n- Not an action/activity\n- Not an emotion/feeling\n- Must be some kind of abstract concept, idea, or intangible state\n\nQuestion 4: Is it a measurable concept (something that can be quantified, like time, distance, temperature, or mathematical concepts)?\n\nThis question helps separate measurable/quantifiable concepts from more qualitative or theoretical ideas.",
    "Let me analyze what we know:\n- Not physical/tangible\n- Not an action/activity\n- Not an emotion/feeling\n- Not a measurable/quantifiable concept\n- Must be some kind of abstract, qualitative concept or idea\n\nThis is pointing towards something more theoretical, philosophical, or conceptual - like a principle, quality, theory, or abstract idea.\n\nQuestion 5: Is it a human-created concept (like a philosophical idea, social construct, or cultural concept) as opposed to something that exists independently of human thought?\n\nThis question helps separate human intellectual/cultural constructs from natural/universal concepts.",
    "Let me analyze what we know:\n- Not physical/tangible\n- Not an action/activity\n- Not an emotion/feeling\n- Not a measurable/quantifiable concept\n- Is a human-created concept\n- Must be some kind of abstract, socially/culturally constructed idea\n\nThis suggests we're dealing with something like a social construct, philosophical concept, cultural idea, or human-devised system of thought.\n\nQuestion 6: Is it related to organizing or governing human society (like laws, politics, economics, or social institutions)?\n\nThis question helps distinguish between societal/organizational concepts versus other types of human constructs (like art, language, or philosophy).",
    "Let me analyze what we know:\n- Not physical/tangible\n- Not an action/activity\n- Not an emotion/feeling\n- Not a measurable/quantifiable concept\n- Is a human-created concept\n- Not related to organizing/governing society\n- Must be some kind of abstract, human-created concept in domains like art, language, philosophy, or cultural expression\n\nQuestion 7: Is it related to communication or language (like a linguistic concept, form of expression, or way of conveying meaning)?\n\nThis helps separate language/communication concepts from other cultural domains like art, philosophy, or belief systems.",
    "Let me analyze what we know:\n- Not physical/tangible\n- Not an action/activity\n- Not an emotion/feeling\n- Not a measurable/quantifiable concept\n- Is a human-created concept\n- Not related to organizing/governing society\n- Not related to communication/language\n- Must be a human-created concept in domains like art, philosophy, religion, or cultural values\n\nGiven this pattern, we're likely dealing with something in the realm of art, philosophy, religion, or abstract cultural concepts.\n\nQuestion 8: Is it related to art or aesthetics (like an artistic style, aesthetic principle, or creative concept)?\n\nThis helps determine if we're in the artistic/creative domain versus other cultural domains like philosophy or religion.",
    "Let me analyze what we know:\n- Not physical/tangible\n- Not an action/activity\n- Not an emotion/feeling\n- Not a measurable/quantifiable concept\n- Is a human-created concept\n- Not related to organizing/governing society\n- Not related to communication/language\n- Not related to art/aesthetics\n- Must be a human-created concept in domains like philosophy, religion, or cultural values\n\nWe're narrowing down to something in the realm of philosophy, religion, or fundamental belief systems.\n\nQuestion 9: Is it related to religion or spiritual beliefs (like a religious concept, spiritual idea, or supernatural belief)?\n\nThis helps separate religious/spiritual concepts from philosophical or other cultural ideas.",
    "Let me analyze the uncertain \"Maybe\" response to religion/spirituality:\n- The uncertainty suggests it might be something that overlaps between religious/spiritual concepts and other domains, or something that can be interpreted both religiously and non-religiously.\n- It might be a concept that appears in religious contexts but isn't exclusively religious.\n\nQuestion 10: Is it a concept related to human morality or ethics (like virtue, justice, good/evil, right/wrong)?\n\nThis question helps determine if we're dealing with moral/ethical concepts, which often overlap with both religious and philosophical domains, which would explain the \"maybe\" response to the religious question.",
    "Let me analyze what we know:\n- Not physical/tangible\n- Not an action/activity\n- Not an emotion/feeling\n- Not a measurable/quantifiable concept\n- Is a human-created concept\n- Not related to organizing/governing society\n- Not related to communication/language\n- Not related to art/aesthetics\n- Maybe related to religion/spirituality\n- Not related to morality/ethics\n\nThe \"maybe\" on religion combined with these other characteristics suggests we might be dealing with something that exists in both religious and non-religious contexts - perhaps something metaphysical or related to human understanding of existence/reality.\n\nQuestion 11: Is it related to human understanding of existence, reality, or the nature of being (like a metaphysical concept, theory of existence, or philosophical view of reality)?\n\nThis helps determine if we're in the domain of metaphysics and fundamental questions about existence and reality, which would explain the overlap with religious thought while not being strictly religious or moral in nature.",
    "Let me analyze what we know:\n- Not physical/tangible\n- Not an action/activity\n- Not an emotion/feeling\n- Not a measurable/quantifiable concept\n- Is a human-created concept\n- Not related to organizing/governing society\n- Not related to communication/language\n- Not related to art/aesthetics\n- Maybe related to religion/spirituality\n- Not related to morality/ethics\n- Related to human understanding of existence/reality/being\n\nWe're dealing with a metaphysical or philosophical concept about the nature of existence that might have religious implications. This suggests concepts like:\n- Soul/consciousness\n- Free will\n- Destiny/fate\n- Purpose/meaning\n- Truth/reality\n- Time/eternity\n- Afterlife\n\nQuestion 12: Is it related to human consciousness or the nature of the mind/soul (as opposed to other aspects of existence like destiny, time, or physical reality)?\n\nThis helps determine if we're dealing with concepts about consciousness/mind/soul versus other metaphysical concepts.",

    "Let me analyze what we've narrowed down to:\n- A human-created concept about collective/shared consciousness\n- Has religious/spiritual implications\n- Not about individual consciousness\n- Deals with consciousness at a universal/collective level\n\nThe most prominent concepts in this space are:\n- Collective unconscious (Jung's theory)\n- Universal mind/cosmic consciousness\n- Hive mind\n- Group consciousness/collective intelligence\n- Noosphere\n\nGiven that it has religious/spiritual implications but isn't strictly religious, and deals with shared consciousness at a broad level, I'm ready to make a guess."
