    "Is it a living thing?",
    "Since it's not a living thing, I'll try to narrow down the category of objects.\n\nQuestion 2: Is it something that can be found in a typical household?",
    "Since it's a household item, let me narrow it down further.\n\nQuestion 3: Is it primarily used in the kitchen?\n\nRemember, I'm trying to eliminate large categories with each question to maximize efficiency. The answer about it being found in a typical household gives us a good direction, and now I'm trying to determine which room or function it might serve.",
    "Since it's a kitchen item, I'll continue narrowing down by function.\n\nQuestion 4: Is it used for food preparation (as opposed to food storage or cooking)?\n\nThis question helps divide kitchen items into major functional categories - preparation tools (like knives, cutting boards, measuring cups), cooking vessels (like pots and pans), or storage items (like containers, jars).",
    "Let me analyze what we know:\n- Not a living thing\n- Found in typical households\n- Used in the kitchen\n- Not used for food preparation\n- Must be for cooking or storage\n\nQuestion 5: Is it used for cooking food (as opposed to storage)?\n\nThis question helps distinguish between cooking vessels/tools (pots, pans, baking sheets) and storage items (containers, refrigerator, cabinets).",
    "Let me analyze what we know:\n- Not a living thing\n- Found in typical households\n- Used in the kitchen\n- Not for food preparation\n- Used for cooking food\n\nQuestion 6: Is it used on/in the stovetop (as opposed to the oven)?\n\nThis question helps separate stovetop cooking items (pots, pans, skillets) from oven items (baking sheets, casserole dishes, roasting pans).",
    "Let me analyze what we know:\n- Not a living thing\n- Found in typical households\n- Used in the kitchen\n- Not for food preparation\n- Used for cooking food\n- Not used on stovetop\n- Must be used in oven\n\nQuestion 7: Is it a flat/shallow item used for baking (like a baking sheet or cookie sheet) rather than a deep dish?\n\nThis question helps distinguish between flat baking items (baking sheets, cookie sheets) and deeper baking vessels (casserole dishes, roasting pans, cake pans).",

    "Let me analyze what we know:\n- Not a living thing\n- Found in typical households\n- Used in the kitchen\n- Not for food preparation\n- Used for cooking food\n- Not used on stovetop\n- Used in oven\n- Not a flat/shallow baking item\n- Deep cooking vessel for the oven\n- Not primarily for desserts/cakes\n\nGiven these clues, we're likely dealing with a deep dish used for savory cooking in the oven, like a casserole dish, roasting pan, or Dutch oven.\n\nQuestion 9: Is it primarily used for roasting meat (like a roasting pan)?\n\nThis question helps distinguish between a roasting pan and other deep oven dishes like casserole dishes or Dutch ovens.",

    "(Incorrect guess: Dutch oven)",
    "Let me reassess. I realize I jumped to a conclusion without fully exploring all possibilities. Let me try a different angle.\n\nQuestion 12: Is this item primarily made of metal (as opposed to other materials like silicone, plastic, etc.)?\n\nThis will help determine the material composition since we know it's not glass/ceramic. Understanding the material could help identify its specific use case in oven cooking.",
    "Based on all the previous information, it appears I should continue asking questions since the item hasn't been definitively identified yet.\n\nQuestion 13: Let me analyze what we know:\n- Not a living thing\n- Found in typical households\n- Used in the kitchen\n- Not for food preparation\n- Used for cooking food\n- Not used on stovetop (this might need verification since Dutch ovens typically can be used on both stovetop and oven)\n- Used in oven\n- Not made of glass/ceramic\n\nQuestion 13: Can this item be used on both stovetop AND in the oven? \n\n(I'm asking this because I need to verify if my previous understanding about stovetop usage was correct, as Dutch ovens are typically versatile for both stovetop and oven use)",
    "Let me analyze what we know:\n- Not a living thing\n- Found in typical households\n- Used in the kitchen\n- Not for food preparation\n- Used for cooking food\n- Not used on stovetop\n- Used in oven\n- Not a flat/shallow baking item\n- Deep cooking vessel for the oven\n- Not primarily for desserts/cakes\n- Not primarily for roasting meat\n- Not made of glass/ceramic\n- Not primarily made of metal\n\nThis is interesting - it's used in the oven but isn't made of traditional oven-safe materials like metal, glass, or ceramic. This suggests it might be made of a special heat-resistant material.\n\nQuestion 14: Is it made primarily of silicone?\n\nThis question helps identify if it's one of the modern silicone baking products that have become popular in recent years.",

    "Let me analyze the situation carefully:\nWe have an item that:\n- Is used in the kitchen for cooking (not prep)\n- Is used in the oven only\n- Is not primarily made of metal, glass, ceramic, or silicone\n- Is not for desserts or roasting meat\n- Is a deep vessel (not flat/shallow)\n- Is found in typical households\n\nThe material limitations are particularly puzzling since we've eliminated most common oven-safe materials.\n\nQuestion 17: Is this item made primarily of heat-resistant plastic?\n\nThis question helps identify if it's one of the specialized plastic-based oven products that exist, given we've eliminated other common oven-safe materials.",
    "Let me carefully analyze everything we know:\n- Not a living thing\n- Found in typical households\n- Used in the kitchen\n- Not for food preparation\n- Used for cooking food\n- Not used on stovetop\n- Used in oven\n- Not a flat/shallow baking item\n- Deep cooking vessel for the oven\n- Not primarily for desserts/cakes\n- Not primarily for roasting meat\n- Not made of glass/ceramic\n- Not primarily made of metal\n- Not made of silicone\n- Can't be used on stovetop\n- Not a cooking/oven bag\n\nQuestion 18: Is it used to line or cover other cookware when cooking in the oven (like aluminum foil or parchment paper)?\n\nThis question explores items that aren't standalone cooking vessels but are still used for cooking in the oven.",
    "Let me carefully analyze everything we know:\n- Used in the kitchen for cooking in oven only\n- Not primarily made of metal, glass, ceramic, silicone, or heat-resistant plastic\n- Not for desserts or roasting meat\n- Is a deep vessel\n- Found in typical households\n- Not a cooking/oven bag\n- Cannot be used on stovetop\n\nThe material limitations and cooking purposes are very puzzling. It seems we might be thinking too conventionally about what constitutes a \"deep vessel\" or cooking container.\n\nQuestion 19: Is it a type of cooking parchment or paper product?\n\nThis question explores non-traditional cooking vessels that might still be considered \"deep\" when formed into shape for use.",
    "Let me make one final analysis:\nWe have an item that:\n- Is used in the kitchen for cooking (not prep)\n- Is used in the oven only\n- Is not primarily made of metal, glass, ceramic, silicone, or plastic\n- Is not for desserts or roasting meat specifically\n- Is a deep vessel (not flat/shallow)\n- Is found in typical households\n- Is not used to line/cover other cookware\n- Is not a cooking bag\n\nQuestion 20: Is it some form of basket used for cooking in the oven (like a bread proofing basket or vegetable roasting basket)?\n\nThis is my final question before making a guess, as we've eliminated most other possibilities for oven cooking vessels that aren't made of traditional materials."
