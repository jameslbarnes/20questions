    "I'll help you play 20 Questions by asking strategic questions that efficiently narrow down the possibilities.\n\nIs it something physical/tangible?",
    "Question 2: Is it something that is made by humans (manufactured or constructed)?",
    "I'll continue with strategic questions to narrow down the physical, non-manufactured entity.\n\nQuestion 3: Is it a living organism (animal, plant, fungus, etc.)?\nAnswer:",
    "Building on what I know: it's physical, not human-made, and a living organism.\n\nQuestion 4: Is it an animal (as opposed to a plant, fungus, or other living organism)?",
    "Question 5: Is it a plant (as opposed to a fungus, bacteria, or other non-animal organism)?",
    "I'll continue narrowing down systematically based on what I know: it's a physical, natural, living organism that is a plant.\n\nQuestion 6: Is it a flowering plant (angiosperm)?",
    "I'm making steady progress in narrowing down the possibilities. Let me continue with strategic questions about this physical, natural flowering plant.\n\nQuestion 7: Is it a tree (as opposed to a shrub, herb, grass, vine, etc.)?\nAnswer:",
    "Question 8: Is it a fruit-bearing tree?",
    "I'll continue narrowing down systematically, focusing on what type of fruit tree it is.\n\nQuestion 9: Is it a tree commonly grown for commercial fruit production (such as apple, orange, cherry, etc.)?",
    "Question 10: Is it a tree that produces fruits with seeds enclosed in a hard pit/stone (like peach, cherry, plum)?\nAnswer:",
    "Based on what I know so far: it's a physical, natural, living flowering plant that is a tree. It bears fruit, is commonly grown commercially, but does not produce fruits with pits/stones.\n\nQuestion 11: Does this tree produce fruits that are commonly eaten fresh (as opposed to being primarily processed for juice, oil, etc.)?",
    "Question 12: Is this fruit tree in the Rosaceae family (which includes apples, pears, and similar pome fruits)?",
    "I'm making good progress in narrowing down the possibilities. It's a physical, natural, fruit-bearing tree in the Rosaceae family that produces commercially grown fruits without pits, commonly eaten fresh.\n\nQuestion 13: Is it an apple tree (Malus domestica)?",
