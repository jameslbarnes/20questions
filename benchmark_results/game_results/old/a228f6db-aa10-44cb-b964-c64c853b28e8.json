  "final_guess": "a wooden shelf or shelving unit (like an open bookcase or display shelf) used for general storage purposes.\n\nThe answers have been somewhat contradictory - you confirmed it has shelves and is for storage, but ruled out most specific storage purposes (books, media, decorative items, small household items, electronics, office supplies, plants). Since it's a wooden storage item with open shelves found in living rooms but not primarily for any of the specific categories I asked about, a general-purpose shelving unit seems most likely.",
