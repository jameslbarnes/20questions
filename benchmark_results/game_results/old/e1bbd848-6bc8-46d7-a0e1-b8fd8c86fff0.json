    "# 20 Questions - Game Start\n\nI'll start with a broad question that helps divide the universe of possibilities:\n\nQuestion 1: Is it a physical/tangible object?",
    "Question 2: Is it an abstract concept (like an idea, emotion, or quality) rather than an event, process, or digital entity?",
    "Question 3: Is it an emotion or feeling that humans experience (like love, fear, happiness)?",
    "Question 4: Is this abstract concept primarily studied or defined within a specific academic discipline (like mathematics, philosophy, or science)?",
    "Question 5: Is this abstract concept primarily studied in STEM fields (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) rather than humanities or social sciences?",
    "Question 6: Is this abstract concept primarily from mathematics (as opposed to natural sciences, engineering, or computer science)?",
    "Question 7: Is this abstract concept primarily studied in physics or chemistry (rather than biology, computer science, or engineering)?",
    "Question 8: Is this abstract concept primarily studied in physics (rather than chemistry)?",
    "Question 9: Is this abstract concept related to one of the fundamental forces in physics (gravity, electromagnetism, strong nuclear force, weak nuclear force)?",
    "Question 10: Is this abstract concept part of classical physics (developed before the 20th century) rather than modern physics (like quantum mechanics or relativity)?",
    "Question 11: Is this abstract concept primarily associated with quantum mechanics (as opposed to relativity or other areas of modern physics)?",
    "Question 12: Is this abstract concept related to the probabilistic or uncertain nature of quantum mechanics (such as superposition, uncertainty principle, or wave function collapse)?",
    "Question 13: Is this abstract concept specifically about the relationship between two complementary properties of a quantum system (like position and momentum)?",
    "Question 14: Is this abstract concept related to quantum superposition (the phenomenon where quantum systems can exist in multiple states simultaneously)?",
    "Question 15: Is this abstract concept related to wave function collapse (the phenomenon where quantum systems transition from multiple possibilities to a single measured state)?",
    "Question 16: Is this abstract concept related to quantum entanglement (the phenomenon where quantum particles become correlated in such a way that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently)?"
