I'll start with broad, fundamental categorization questions to divide the possibilities most efficiently.\n\nLet me think about what my first question should be. The most fundamental division is probably whether the thing is physical/tangible or not. This separates concrete objects from abstract concepts, ideas, fictional characters, etc.\n\nSo my first question will be about whether it's physical/tangible."

Is it something that exists in reality (as opposed to fiction or hypothetical)?\n2. Is it something that humans created or defined (as opposed to natural phenomena)?\n3. Is it something that can be experienced directly by humans?\n\nI think the most efficient question is about whether it's something created/defined by humans versus something that would exist independent of human thought or society."

Quantum entanglement is not exactly a property of individual particles, but rather describes a relationship or correlation between multiple particles.\n\n2. It's also not simply a \"state\" of a single quantum particle, but rather a state of a system of particles.\n\n3.
