    "I'll play 20 Questions! Let me start with a broad question to begin narrowing down the possibilities.\n\nIs it a physical object (something you can touch)?",
    "Question 2: Is this physical object larger than a microwave oven?",
    "I see the object is physical but has an uncertain size compared to a microwave.\n\nQuestion 3: Is this object commonly found in households?\nAnswer:",
    "I'll continue with my questions to narrow down this physical object that isn't commonly found in households.\n\nQuestion 4: Is this object used in a specific profession or industry?",
    "Question 5: Is this object used in a medical or healthcare setting?",
    "Question 6: Is this object used in construction or manufacturing industries?",
    "I need to narrow down what industry this object belongs to.\n\nQuestion 7: Is this object used in transportation or automotive industries?",
    "I need to continue narrowing down what industry this physical object is used in.\n\nQuestion 8: Is this object used in agriculture or farming?",
    "I'll continue exploring different industries to identify where this object is used.\n\nQuestion 9: Is this object used in scientific research or laboratories?\nAnswer:",
    "I now know this is a physical object used in scientific research or laboratories that isn't commonly found in households.\n\nQuestion 10: Is this object used for measuring or analyzing something?",
    "I'm making progress narrowing down this physical object used in scientific research for measurement or analysis.\n\nQuestion 11: Does this object use electricity or require power to function?\nAnswer:",
    "I'm making good progress! This is a physical object used in scientific research/laboratories for measuring or analyzing something, and it requires electricity to function.\n\nQuestion 12: Is this object primarily used for analyzing chemical samples or compounds?",
    "Thank you for the information. I now know this is a powered measurement or analysis device used in scientific research/laboratories, but not primarily for chemical analysis.\n\nQuestion 13: Is this object used for observing or analyzing biological specimens?",
    "I'm narrowing down this laboratory measurement device that uses electricity but isn't for chemical or biological analysis.\n\nQuestion 14: Is this object used for measuring or analyzing physical properties (like weight, temperature, pressure, etc.)?",
    "I'm making good progress understanding what this object is. Let me continue narrowing it down.\n\nQuestion 15: Is this device used specifically for measuring or analyzing properties related to light, radiation, or electromagnetic waves?",
    "I've learned that this object is:\n- A physical object\n- Used in scientific research/laboratories\n- Used for measuring or analyzing something\n- Requires electricity to function\n- Used for measuring physical properties\n- Specifically deals with light, radiation, or electromagnetic waves\n- Not commonly found in households\n- Not used in medical, construction, transportation, or agricultural industries\n\nQuestion 16: Is this device a spectrometer or spectroscope (device that measures properties of light across the electromagnetic spectrum)?",
    "Question 17: Is this device used for detecting or measuring nuclear radiation (like alpha, beta, or gamma radiation)?",
    "Let me think carefully about what this could be. It's a powered device used in laboratories for measuring physical properties related to light, radiation, or electromagnetic waves, but it's not a spectrometer or nuclear radiation detector.\n\nQuestion 18: Is this device used to measure magnetic fields or electromagnetic properties?",
    "I now have a much clearer picture of what this object might be. It's a powered laboratory device used for measuring magnetic fields or electromagnetic properties, related to light/radiation/electromagnetic waves, but not a spectrometer or radiation detector.\n\nQuestion 19: Is this device a magnetometer (an instrument that measures the strength and/or direction of magnetic fields)?",
    "I'm trying to narrow down this laboratory device that measures magnetic fields or electromagnetic properties, but isn't a magnetometer or spectrometer.\n\nQuestion 20: Is this device an oscilloscope (an instrument used to visualize and analyze electrical signals and waveforms)?"
