  "final_guess": "a page turner/page turning device\n\nBased on all the information gathered, I believe the object is a page turner - a small handheld device that helps people turn pages while reading. It fits all the criteria:\n- Physical/tangible man-made object\n- Used indoors, particularly in office settings \n- Small enough to hold in hand\n- Non-electronic\n- Has a practical purpose\n- Related to books/reading\n- Not for writing, binding, measuring, cutting, organizing or protecting books\n- Not for supporting books, marking pages, or enhancing vision\n- Not a bookmark or protective item\n\nA page turner would be particularly useful for people with limited dexterity or those who want to keep their hands clean while reading.",
