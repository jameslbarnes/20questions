    "I'll start with a fundamental question to divide the universe of possibilities.\n\nQuestion 1: Is it a physical/tangible object?",
    "Question 2: Is it something that humans created or defined (as opposed to something that exists independently of human conception)?",
    "Question 3: Is it something that can be directly experienced or observed through our senses (seen, heard, felt, etc.), even if it's not physically tangible?",
    "Question 4: Is it something that is formally studied in academic or scientific disciplines?",
    "Question 5: Is it primarily studied in the natural sciences (such as physics, chemistry, biology) rather than social sciences or humanities?",
    "Question 6: Is it primarily studied in fields related to human behavior or human society (such as psychology, sociology, economics, or political science)?",
    "Question 7: Is it a specific concept, theory, or framework (as opposed to an entire field of study or discipline)?",
    "Question 8: Is it primarily concerned with individual human behavior or psychology (as opposed to group dynamics, societal structures, or larger social systems)?",
    "Question 9: Is it related to personality traits, individual differences, or how people typically behave (as opposed to cognitive processes like memory, learning, or decision-making)?",
    "Question 10: Is it a comprehensive model or framework that classifies or categorizes multiple personality traits (as opposed to a single specific trait or characteristic)?",
    "Question 11: Is this personality model/framework widely accepted in mainstream academic psychology and supported by substantial peer-reviewed research (as opposed to being more popular in business contexts or personal development)?",
    "Question 12: Does this personality framework categorize people into distinct types or groups (as opposed to measuring traits on continuous scales)?",
    "Question 13: Is it the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personality classification system?",
    "Question 14: Does this personality framework have ancient or pre-modern origins (as opposed to being developed primarily in the 20th century)?",
    "Question 15: Is it the Enneagram personality typing system that categorizes people into 9 different types?",
    "Question 16: Is this personality framework primarily used in business, organizational, or professional contexts (such as team-building, workplace dynamics, or leadership development)?",
    "Question 17: Is this personality framework associated with or influenced by concepts from astrology, spiritual beliefs, or other systems that mainstream science would consider pseudoscientific?",
    "Question 18: Does this personality framework categorize people into 4 or fewer distinct types/groups?",
    "Question 19: Is it the Socionics personality typing system (a psychological theory that classifies people into 16 different types, similar to but distinct from MBTI)?",
    "I've been narrowing down personality typing systems and have eliminated many major ones. For my final question:\n\nQuestion 20: Is this personality framework primarily designed for or associated with career counseling, vocational guidance, or helping people determine suitable occupations?"

  "final_guess": "The Big Five personality traits (also known as the Five-Factor Model)\n\nThough you indicated it categorizes people into distinct types rather than continuous scales (which would normally rule out the Big Five), it best fits the other criteria: it's a comprehensive personality framework studied in psychology, not widely embraced in all academic circles despite having research support, developed in the 20th century, has more than 4 dimensions, and isn't primarily associated with business contexts, career counseling, or pseudoscience. It's also distinct from MBTI, Enneagram, and Socionics.",
