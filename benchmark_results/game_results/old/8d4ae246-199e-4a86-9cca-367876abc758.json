    "Question 2: Is the entity you're thinking of a physical object?",
    "Based on the answers so far, it seems that the entity is neither a living being nor a physical object, which might suggest it's a concept or perhaps an abstract idea.\n\nQuestion 3: Is the entity you're thinking of a concept or idea?",
    "Question 4: Is the concept you're thinking of related to a specific field, like science, art, or philosophy?",
    "Question 5: Is the concept you're thinking of primarily related to science?",
    "Question 6: Is the concept you're thinking of primarily related to art?",

    "It seems like I had an incorrect guess marked as correct and there may be some confusion. Let's clarify and try to narrow it down further.\n\nQuestion 17: Does the concept involve finding a balance or a mean between extremes in virtues?",
    "It seems there might have been some misunderstanding with the question numbering, but let's move forward with the information we have. We know the concept is related to Aristotle and virtue ethics, but it's not the \"Golden Mean.\" Let's try to narrow it down further.\n\nQuestion 18: Is the concept you're thinking of related to happiness or eudaimonia in Aristotle's philosophy?",
    "It seems like the concept you're thinking of is closely tied to Aristotle's philosophy, particularly virtue ethics, eudaimonia, and happiness. Let's try to confirm this with one more question before making a guess.\n\nQuestion 19: Is the concept you're thinking of related to how virtue is essential for achieving eudaimonia or happiness according to Aristotle?",
