  "final_guess": "Jack Russell Terrier\n\nThis was challenging! I've ruled out most typical working dog categories, which makes this tricky. The dog is:\n- A conventional pet dog\n- Medium-sized (not small/toy, not large)\n- A working dog, but not primarily for herding, hunting, guarding, service/therapy, detection/search/rescue, or pulling sleds\n\nJack Russell Terriers were historically working dogs (for vermin control), are medium-sized, and are kept as pets. They don't neatly fit into the specific working categories I ruled out, which makes them my best guess given the constraints.",
