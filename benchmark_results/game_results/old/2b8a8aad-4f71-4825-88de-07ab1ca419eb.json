    "# 20 Questions Game\n\nI'll begin with a fundamental question to divide the possibilities:\n\nIs it something physical/tangible (something you can touch)?",
    "Question 2:\n\nIs it a concept, idea, or abstract notion (rather than something that exists in a specific form even if intangible)?",
    "Question 3:\n\nIs it related to human emotions or feelings (like love, fear, happiness, etc.)?",
    "Question 4:\n\nIs it generally considered a positive emotion or feeling (as opposed to negative or neutral)?",
    "# Question 5:\n\nIs it a fear-based emotion (like fear, anxiety, dread, panic, etc.)?",
    "# Question 6:\n\nIs it an anger-based emotion or feeling (like anger, rage, frustration, resentment, etc.)?",
    "# Question 7:\n\nIs it a sadness-based emotion or feeling (like sadness, grief, depression, melancholy, etc.)?",
    "# Question 8:\n\nIs it a complex emotional state that could include elements of disgust, shame, or social discomfort (like embarrassment, jealousy, guilt, or disgust)?",
    "# Question 9:\n\nIs it related to the absence, suppression, or lack of emotions (like apathy, numbness, emotional detachment, etc.)?",
    "# Question 10:\n\nI've ruled out many common emotional categories. Is it an emotion itself, or is it more of a concept/phenomenon related to emotions (like emotional intelligence, catharsis, etc.)?",
    "# Question 11:\n\nThere seems to be a contradiction between you saying it IS related to human emotions (Question 3) but is NOT an emotion or concept related to emotions (Question 10). Let me clarify: Is it something that causes or evokes emotions, rather than being an emotion or emotional concept itself?",
    "# Question 12:\n\nIs it a form of art, entertainment, or creative expression (like music, literature, film, etc.) that evokes emotions?",
    "# Question 13:\n\nIs it related to a significant life event or personal experience that typically causes strong emotional responses (like loss, failure, trauma, etc.)?",
    "# Question 14:\n\nIs it related to interpersonal or social dynamics between people (like rejection, conflict, relationship dynamics, etc.) that typically trigger emotional responses?",
    "# Question 15:\n\nIs it related to existential concepts or philosophical ideas (like mortality, purpose, meaning of life, etc.)?",
    "# Question 16:\n\nIs it related to mortality, death, or the finitude of human existence?",
    "# Question 17:\n\nIs it related to the concept of purpose, meaning, or the search for significance in human existence?",
    "# Question 18:\n\nIs it related to the concept of free will, choice, or human agency (as opposed to determinism or fate)?",
    "# Question 19:\n\nIs it related to the concept of human suffering, the absence of meaning, or the inherent absurdity of existence (like nihilism, existential crisis, or the philosophical concept of the absurd)?",
    "# Question 20:\n\nIs it related to the concept of human consciousness, self-awareness, or the nature of personal identity?"
