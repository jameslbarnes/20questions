Decorative purposes: some books are placed on coffee tables or bookshelves partly for decorative purposes\n\nWhile some books are certainly practical, many books are primarily for entertainment (fiction books). And there's a large market for books that are read primarily for entertainment purposes.\n\nSince books serve both practical and entertainment purposes in significant ways, I should probably answer \"maybe\" with a clarification. However, if I need to choose between yes and no, I would say that many books are primarily for entertainment rather than practical purposes, though this varies greatly by the type of book.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The question asks if it's \"primarily\" used for practical purposes rather than decorative or entertainment. While books do have a strong entertainment function, they also have strong practical functions (education, reference, instruction). And historically books were primarily practical tools before mass entertainment. \n\nThis is a tough call, but I think I should say \"maybe\" since books have significant practical AND entertainment purposes, not clearly primarily one over the other."

      "thinking": "I need to compare the size of a book to a microwave oven.\n\nBooks come in many different sizes, from very small pocket books to large coffee table books, encyclopedias, or textbooks. However, even the largest books are typically smaller than a standard microwave oven.\n\nA typical microwave oven might be around:\n- 1-2 feet wide\n- 1-1.5 feet tall\n- 1-1.5 feet deep\n\nEven large books like encyclopedias or coffee table books would generally be:\n- Less than 1.5 feet in any dimension\n- Much thinner than a microwave\n\nSo, the accurate answer to whether a book is larger than a microwave oven would be \"no.\" Books are generally smaller than microwave ovens."

You can read a book anywhere without power - that's one of its advantages. It doesn't need batteries or charging.\n\nWhile e-books and digital readers do require electricity, the concept of \"book\" that I'm representing in this game would be the traditional physical book, which functions perfectly well without any power source.\n\nSo my answer is clearly \"no\" - a book does not use or require electricity to function."

While some homes might keep cookbooks in the kitchen, most books are typically stored in living rooms, bedrooms, offices, or on bookshelves throughout the home.\n\nCookbooks specifically would be found in kitchens, but the object I'm thinking of is \"book\" in general, not specifically a cookbook. Most books aren't kept in kitchens as a primary location.\n\nSo the most accurate answer would be \"no\" - while some specific types of books might be found in kitchens, books in general are not commonly found there as their primary location."
