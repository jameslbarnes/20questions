I should start with the broadest possible questions that divide the universe of possibilities into roughly equal halves.\n\nLet's think about what my first question should be. One of the most fundamental divisions is between physical, tangible objects and abstract concepts/ideas. This divides the possibility space very broadly.\n\nQuestion 1: \"Is it a physical object/something tangible?\"\n\nThis will help me determine if I'm dealing with:\n- Physical objects (chair, mountain, dog, book, etc.)\n- OR abstract things (emotion, idea, language, event, relationship, etc.)\n\nAfter getting that answer, I'll refine my strategy based on which branch we're going down. I'll keep tracking what I learn from each answer to build a mental model of what we're looking for."

Some good next questions might be:\n\n1. Is it something natural (vs. human-made/manufactured)?\n2. Is it alive or of biological origin?\n3. Is it commonly found in households?\n4. Is it larger than a microwave oven?\n\nI think the natural vs. manufactured question would be a good division. It splits physical objects into roughly equal categories and helps me narrow down significantly.\n\nActually, the alive vs. not alive question might be even more fundamental, as it would immediately tell me if we're dealing with organisms, plants, animals, humans versus inanimate objects.\n\nI'll go with the alive/biological question next as it seems most fundamental for dividing physical objects."

Corals are the foundation species of the reef ecosystem.\n\nThe question specifically asks if \"it\" (the Great Barrier Reef) is an animal as opposed to a plant, fungus, or microorganism. While corals are animals, the Great Barrier Reef as a whole is an ecosystem composed of:\n- Corals (which are animals)\n- Various fish species\n- Marine mammals\n- Mollusks\n- Crustaceans\n- Algae (which are not animals)\n- Seagrasses (which are not animals)\n- Microorganisms\n- And many other forms of life\n\nSince the Great Barrier Reef is not a single animal but rather an ecosystem containing many animals (as well as other life forms), I should answer \"no\" with a clarification that it's an ecosystem containing many animals."
