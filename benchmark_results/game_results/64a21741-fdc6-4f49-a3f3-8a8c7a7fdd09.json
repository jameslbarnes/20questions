She was born on November 7, 1867, and died on July 4, 1934, due to aplastic anemia, believed to be caused by her prolonged exposure to radiation through her research.\n\nSince Marie Curie died in 1934, she is not currently alive.

While she didn't specifically work on nuclear physics as it's understood today (nuclear fission, fusion, etc.), her work on radioactivity was fundamental to the development of atomic and nuclear physics.\n\nRadioactivity is the process by which unstable atomic nuclei lose energy by emitting radiation, which is certainly related to nuclear physics. Her research laid groundwork for later developments in nuclear physics.\n\nSo while she didn't work directly on nuclear reactors or nuclear weapons, her research on radioactive elements and radiation was absolutely part of the early foundations of what would become nuclear physics.\n\nI would say the correct answer is \"yes\" since her work on radioactivity is considered part of the early foundations of nuclear physics, even if the field wasn't fully developed during her lifetime."
