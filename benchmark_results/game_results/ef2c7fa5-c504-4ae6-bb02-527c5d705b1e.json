Unicorns appear in ancient Greek accounts, medieval European mythology, and across many cultures. They weren't created for or by any specific book, movie, TV show, or video game.\n\nRather than originating from a specific fictional work, unicorns are part of general mythology and folklore that has been incorporated into countless works of fiction over the centuries.\n\nSo the most accurate answer would be \"no\" - unicorns aren't from an established work of fiction, they're a mythological creature that has appeared in many works rather than originating from one."
