Does it exist in the present day?\n\nThe first question about whether it's physical/tangible seems like the most fundamental division. This would separate physical objects from abstract concepts, ideas, fictional things, etc. This gives me the broadest possible split to start with.\n\nSo my first question will be about whether the thing is physical or tangible."

Horses are mammals, and since unicorns are essentially horses with a horn, they would be considered mammals or mammal-like creatures.\n\nUnicorns have the basic characteristics of mammals:\n- They have four legs\n- They have hair/fur\n- They would presumably be warm-blooded\n- They would presumably give birth to live young (rather than laying eggs)\n- They would presumably produce milk for their young\n\nSo the answer to whether a unicorn is a mammal or mammal-like creature would be yes."

Unicorns are equine (horse-like), not canine (dog-like). \n\nHorses belong to the family Equidae, while canines belong to the family Canidae. These are completely different taxonomic families. Unicorns, being horse-like mythical creatures, would be considered equine, not canine.\n\nSo the answer is clearly no, a unicorn is not canine."

Unicorns are equine (horse-like), not feline (cat-like). They have features similar to horses - four legs, a mane, a tail, etc., but are not related to cats, lions, or tigers.\n\nSo the answer to whether a unicorn is feline is clearly \"no\"."

Like horses, they are consistently portrayed with hooves rather than paws or other appendages. In fact, unicorns are essentially horses with a magical horn and sometimes other magical properties, but they maintain the basic body structure of a horse including having hooves.\n\nSince the question asks if it's a \"hooved animal (like a horse, deer, bull, etc.)\", and unicorns definitely have hooves and are very horse-like, the answer is clearly yes."

They typically have the body, head, and legs of a horse, with the addition of the distinctive spiral horn. So unicorns are very much horse-like in appearance - they essentially look like horses with a horn.\n\nSo the answer to this question is yes, unicorns are horse-like in appearance."

The defining characteristic of a unicorn is indeed the single horn on its head.\n\nSo the answer to \"Does this creature have a single horn on its head?\" is clearly yes, as that's the most distinctive feature of a unicorn."
