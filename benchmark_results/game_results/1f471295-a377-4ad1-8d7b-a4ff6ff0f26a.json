A person is not typically considered a \"physical object\" in the way we'd think of objects like a chair, book, or tool. People are living beings (or were living beings, in Beethoven's case).\n\nSo the correct answer would be \"no\" - Beethoven was a person, not a physical/tangible object."

Beethoven was a real person who existed in history. He was known for his musical compositions like the 5th and 9th symphonies, and for continuing to compose even after going deaf.\n\nSince Beethoven was a real person in history, he is not an abstract concept or idea. An abstract concept would be something like \"love,\" \"freedom,\" \"justice,\" etc. Beethoven was a concrete historical figure, not an abstract concept.\n\nSo my answer should be \"no.\""

Events would be things like \"World War II\" or \"the moon landing\" or \"the French Revolution.\" Beethoven was a historical figure, a composer and musician.\n\nSo the answer is clearly no, Beethoven is not a specific event or occurrence."

He was a person, not a form of art or media.

He was a person who lived from 1770 to 1827.\n\nBeethoven was a person, so:\n- He was tangible when he was alive\n- He was a living being (although he is now deceased)\n- He existed in the physical world\n- He is not comparable to phenomena like light, sound, or gravity\n\nSince Beethoven was a person, not an intangible phenomenon, the answer should be \"no\".\n\nHowever, I need to be careful here. In previous answers, I said Beethoven is not:\n- A physical/tangible object (correct, he was a person, not an object)\n- An abstract concept (correct)\n- A specific event (correct)\n- A fictional character (correct)\n- A place (correct)\n- A living being or organism (this is tricky - he was a living being but is now deceased)\n- A form of art or media (his music is, but he himself wasn't)\n- A phenomenon or process (correct)\n\nI'm a bit concerned about my \"no\" answer to question 6 about being a living being. I should have clarified that he was once a living person but is now deceased. \n\nGiven that context, the current question is asking if Beethoven is something like light, sound, or gravity - intangible phenomena. Beethoven was a person, not an intangible phenomenon, so the answer is clearly \"no\"."

People can't \"do Beethoven\" in the sense of it being an action or activity.\n\nPeople might say \"I'm playing Beethoven\" or \"I'm listening to Beethoven,\" but in those cases, the action is \"playing\" or \"listening\" - Beethoven is the object of the action, not the action itself.\n\nSo the answer is clearly \"no.\""
