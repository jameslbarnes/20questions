Let me approach this systematically.\n\nFor my first question, I should establish the broadest possible division. The most fundamental distinction is whether the thing is physical/tangible or not.\n\nQuestion 1: \"Is it physical/tangible?\"\n\nThis will immediately tell me if we're dealing with:\n- A physical object (like a chair, animal, or mountain)\n- OR something abstract (like an idea, emotion, event, or concept)\n\nThis divides the universe of possibilities roughly in half, which is exactly what I want to do with each question.\n\nI'll ask this first question and then follow the binary tree approach based on the answer."

Let me think about what would be a good binary division.\n\nOne approach is to ask if it's something that exists in the real world (even if intangible) versus something fictional or hypothetical. Another approach is to ask if it's something that can be experienced directly by humans.\n\nI think I'll go with asking if it's something that primarily exists in human thought/consciousness versus something that exists independently of human perception."

      "thinking": "The question is asking if Sherlock Holmes is primarily from a book or literature.\n\nSherlock Holmes was created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and first appeared in the novel \"A Study in Scarlet\" in 1887. Sherlock Holmes appeared in four novels and 56 short stories written by Doyle. So he did originate in literature.\n\nWhile Sherlock Holmes has been adapted into many TV shows, movies, and other media formats over the years, he is primarily and originally a literary character.\n\nSo the answer to this question is Yes, Sherlock Holmes is primarily from a book or literature."

      "thinking": "I need to determine if Sherlock Holmes is from a book published in the last 100 years.\n\nSherlock Holmes was created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The first Sherlock Holmes novel, \"A Study in Scarlet,\" was published in 1887. The last Sherlock Holmes story written by Conan Doyle, \"The Adventure of Shoscombe Old Place,\" was published in 1927.\n\nThe current year is 2023, so 100 years ago would be 1923. Most of the original Sherlock Holmes stories were published before 1923, though a few of the last ones were published between 1923-1927.\n\nHowever, the question asks if the character is \"from a book published in the last 100 years.\" While there have been many adaptations, pastiches, and new Sherlock Holmes stories published in the last 100 years, the character originated in works published more than 100 years ago.\n\nSince the character Sherlock Holmes primarily comes from books published more than 100 years ago, I should answer \"no\" to this question."

      "thinking": "The question is asking if Sherlock Holmes is from a work that could be classified as a classic/canonical piece of literature.\n\nSherlock Holmes is a fictional detective created by British author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The character first appeared in 1887 in the novel \"A Study in Scarlet.\" The Sherlock Holmes stories and novels are widely considered classics of detective fiction and are part of the Western literary canon. The character has had enormous influence on detective fiction and popular culture in general.\n\nThe works featuring Sherlock Holmes are definitely considered classic literature and are studied in academic settings. They're canonical in the mystery/detective fiction genre and in British literature more broadly.\n\nSo the answer is clearly \"yes\" - Sherlock Holmes is from works that are classified as classic/canonical literature."

He is not a supernatural being, deity, or non-human creature. He is portrayed as a human being with extraordinary deductive abilities and intelligence, but he is definitely human.\n\nSo the answer to whether Sherlock Holmes is human is yes."

The first Sherlock Holmes story, \"A Study in Scarlet,\" was published in 1887.\n\nSince Sherlock Holmes was created by a British author writing in English, the answer is yes - the character is from a work written originally in English."

      "thinking": "Let me think about the question: \"Is this character male?\"\n\nThe answer is about Sherlock Holmes, who is indeed male. He is portrayed as a male detective in all of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's stories.\n\nSo the answer should be \"yes\"."

      "thinking": "I need to determine whether Sherlock Holmes was from a work published in the 19th century.\n\nSherlock Holmes was created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The first Sherlock Holmes story, \"A Study in Scarlet,\" was published in 1887. The subsequent Holmes stories and novels were published through the late 19th century and into the early 20th century. The final Holmes stories were published in the 1920s.\n\nThe bulk of the original Sherlock Holmes canon was indeed published in the 19th century:\n- A Study in Scarlet (1887)\n- The Sign of the Four (1890)\n- The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (1892)\n- The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes (1894)\n- The Hound of the Baskervilles (serialized 1901-1902, so early 20th century)\n- The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1905)\n- The Valley of Fear (serialized 1914-1915)\n- His Last Bow (1917)\n- The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes (1927)\n\nSo while some Holmes stories were published in the 20th century, the character originated and was prominently featured in works published in the 19th century. Since the question asks if the character is from a work published in the 19th century, the answer is clearly yes."

      "thinking": "I need to determine if Sherlock Holmes is a protagonist or main character in the stories he appears in.\n\nSherlock Holmes is definitely a main character and protagonist in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's detective stories. He is the titular character in many of the stories (like \"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,\" \"The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes,\" etc.), and the stories revolve around his detective work and adventures. While Dr. John Watson narrates most of the stories, Holmes is undoubtedly the central figure and protagonist. \n\nSo the answer to whether Sherlock Holmes is a protagonist or main character in his story is clearly yes."

      "thinking": "Sherlock Holmes novels and stories are primarily detective fiction and mystery stories, not coming-of-age stories. The Sherlock Holmes stories focus on Holmes solving mysteries and crimes using his deductive reasoning skills. They don't follow the typical coming-of-age narrative arc where a young protagonist matures and develops through experiences.\n\nSherlock Holmes is introduced as an already fully formed adult character with his extraordinary deductive abilities. The stories don't chronicle his growth from youth to adulthood or show significant psychological/emotional development that would classify them as coming-of-age stories.\n\nSo the answer is clearly no."

Sherlock Holmes is unquestionably from works that would be classified as mystery or detective stories. In fact, Sherlock Holmes is one of the most famous fictional detectives of all time, appearing in Arthur Conan Doyle's detective stories and novels. The Sherlock Holmes stories are considered foundational works in the detective fiction genre.\n\nSo the answer is clearly yes."

Absolutely yes. This is a core aspect of who Sherlock Holmes is as a character."

      "thinking": "This question is asking about whether the character (Sherlock Holmes) has a close associate or partner who narrates many of his adventures.\n\nSherlock Holmes is indeed known for having a very close associate, Dr. John Watson, who narrates almost all of the Sherlock Holmes stories. Watson is Holmes' friend, roommate, and the narrator/chronicler of Holmes' detective adventures. The vast majority of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories are written from Watson's first-person perspective as he documents Holmes' cases.\n\nSo the answer is definitely \"yes\" - Sherlock Holmes is known for having Dr. Watson as a close associate who narrates many of his adventures."
