This is one of the most fundamental divisions.\n\nQuestion 1: Is it something physical/tangible (as opposed to an abstract concept, idea, or intangible thing)?\n\nThis will help me determine whether I'm looking for a concrete object or something more abstract like an emotion, a concept, a relationship, etc."

This would distinguish between living things (animals, plants, etc.) and non-living things (objects, natural formations, etc.)\n\n2. Is it naturally occurring vs. human-made? This would divide between things like rocks, mountains, animals vs. buildings, tools, technologies.\n\n3. Is it something common/everyday vs. rare/specialized?\n\n4. Is it something that exists in the present day?

It's a wrought-iron lattice tower designed by Gustave Eiffel and built in Paris between 1887 and 1889. It was constructed by humans using manufactured materials (iron), and it was designed and engineered by people. It doesn't occur naturally in any way.\n\nSo the answer is clearly \"yes\" - the Eiffel Tower is manufactured/man-made."

Fixed in place (it's a permanent structure in Paris)\n\nSo the clear answer to this question is \"no\" - the Eiffel Tower is not something you can typically hold in your hand."

While it does have some enclosed spaces (like restaurants, small museums, and observation areas), it's primarily an open framework structure rather than a building with extensive enclosed interior spaces. \n\nThe Eiffel Tower is generally classified as a tower/monument rather than a building. It's fundamentally an open structure with a lattice design allowing visitors to see through it. The enclosed spaces are relatively minimal compared to the overall structure.\n\nSo the accurate answer would be \"no\" - it's not primarily a building with enclosed interior spaces; it's more accurately described as an open structure/tower/monument."

The tower is primarily a tourist attraction and a cultural monument.\n\nSo, is it a structure used *primarily* for industrial or utility purposes?

It was meant to commemorate the centennial of the French Revolution and to demonstrate France's industrial capabilities.\n\nWhile it does serve as a landmark and tourist attraction today, I wouldn't say it's \"primarily decorative or commemorative\" in the same way as a statue or memorial that solely exists to commemorate something. It has served practical purposes too:\n- It's been used as a radio transmission tower\n- It has restaurants and observation decks\n- It serves as a communications platform\n\nThat said, it does have commemorative aspects as it was built for the World's Fair and to celebrate the French Revolution centennial. And today it's certainly a symbol of Paris and France.\n\nI think the most accurate answer is \"maybe\" because while it has decorative and commemorative aspects, I wouldn't say that's its primary purpose. It's more of a multi-purpose landmark and observation tower that also happens to be decorative and have historical significance.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The question asks if it's \"primarily decorative or commemorative in nature.\" While the Eiffel Tower has had utilitarian functions added over time (radio tower, etc.), it was fundamentally built as a demonstration piece and monument. Its primary purpose today is as a landmark and tourist attraction. The restaurants and observation decks are part of its tourist attraction function.\n\nSo I think the most accurate answer is \"yes\" - it is primarily decorative/commemorative rather than purely functional, though it does have some functional aspects."
