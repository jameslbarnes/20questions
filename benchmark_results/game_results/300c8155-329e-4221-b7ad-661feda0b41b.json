It IS related to phosphorescence, fluorescence, or luminescence (emission of visible light not from heat).\n\nSo I'm looking for something that:\n- Is visible to the naked eye\n- Is a natural phenomenon (not human-created)\n- Is related to chemical reactions/energy\n- Is related to phosphorescence, fluorescence, or luminescence\n- Is not in the sky/atmosphere\n- Is not related to heat, electricity, magnetism, sound, gravity, combustion, state changes, oxidation, or acid-base reactions\n\nBased on this information, I think the answer must be either:\n\n1. Bioluminescence - but this would be related to biological processes, which was ruled out\n2. Chemiluminescence - the emission of light as a result of a chemical reaction without significant heat\n3. Natural phosphorescent minerals - minerals that glow after exposure to light\n\nGiven that it's related to chemical reactions and phosphorescence/fluorescence/luminescence, but not biological processes, the most likely answer is either chemiluminescence or natural phosphorescent minerals.\n\nSince it's not a physical object but can be observed, and it's related to chemical reactions that produce light without heat, I think the most likely answer is chemiluminescence itself (the phenomenon, not a specific object that exhibits it).\n\nSome natural examples of chemiluminescence include:\n- Cold light from certain deep-sea creatures (but this might count as biological)\n- Glow of certain minerals in certain conditions\n\nIf I had to make my best guess with the information available, I would say it's chemiluminescence as a natural phenomenon."
