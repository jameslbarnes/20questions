      "thinking": "I need to answer whether an electric guitar is primarily found/used in venues, clubs, or other public entertainment spaces rather than private homes.\n\nElectric guitars are:\n- Commonly found in private homes for practice and amateur playing\n- Used by professional musicians in venues, clubs, and concert halls\n- Used in recording studios\n- Found in music schools and educational settings\n\nElectric guitars are very commonly owned and used by individuals in their homes for practice, learning, and casual playing. At the same time, they are essential instruments in live music performances at venues and clubs.\n\nI wouldn't say they are \"primarily\" found in public entertainment spaces rather than homes. They're quite common in both settings. In fact, there are likely more electric guitars in private homes overall than in public venues, since many guitarists own and practice on them at home, even if they also play in public.\n\nSo the most accurate answer would be \"no\" - they are not primarily found/used in public entertainment spaces rather than homes. They're very common in both settings."

      "thinking": "The question is asking if the thing I'm thinking of (electric guitar) is a musical instrument. \n\nLet me think about this:\n- An electric guitar is definitely a musical instrument\n- It's used to create and play music\n- It's a variant of the guitar that uses electronic pickups to convert the vibration of its strings into electrical signals\n- It's played by musicians and can be found in various settings including homes, studios, and performance venues\n\nSo the answer to the question \"Is it a musical instrument (something you play to create music)?\" is clearly \"yes\" for an electric guitar."

      "thinking": "The question asks if an electric guitar is a keyboard instrument like a piano, organ, or synthesizer.\n\nAn electric guitar is definitely a musical instrument, but it is not a keyboard instrument. It's a stringed instrument that is played by plucking or strumming strings, not by pressing keys. Keyboard instruments have keys that are pressed to produce sounds, while guitars have strings that are plucked or strummed.\n\nSo the answer would be no, an electric guitar is not a keyboard instrument."

      "thinking": "Let's think about whether an electric guitar is a string instrument.\n\nElectric guitars have strings (typically 6 strings) that are plucked or strummed to produce sound. The strings vibrate, and these vibrations are captured by magnetic pickups, converted to electrical signals, and then amplified. \n\nSo yes, an electric guitar is definitely a string instrument. In fact, it's one of the most common and popular string instruments in modern music. It belongs to the same family as acoustic guitars, bass guitars, violins, etc. - all of which are string instruments.\n\nI'll answer \"yes\" to this question."

      "thinking": "The current question is: \"Is it an electric guitar (including bass guitar)?\"\n\nI'm thinking of an electric guitar, which is indeed a string instrument that uses electricity to amplify its sound. \n\nThe question specifically asks about \"electric guitar (including bass guitar)\" - I need to be careful here. My target is specifically an electric guitar, not a bass guitar. While both are electric string instruments, they are different instruments:\n- Electric guitar typically has 6 strings and plays higher notes\n- Bass guitar typically has 4 strings and plays lower notes\n\nSince the player is asking specifically about an electric guitar, and that's exactly what I'm thinking of, I should indicate they've guessed correctly. However, I should clarify that I was thinking specifically of an electric guitar, not a bass guitar, which was included in their question.\n\nI need to respond with \"<answer>correct</answer> You've guessed electric guitar\" since they've mentioned exactly what I'm thinking of."
