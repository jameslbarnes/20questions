Let's break it down:\n\n1. Dark matter - Dark matter is hypothesized to be a form of matter that doesn't interact with the electromagnetic force but would still have gravitational effects. We can't directly see or touch dark matter.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing - This is the effect where mass (including dark matter) bends light as predicted by Einstein's general relativity. The bending of light around massive objects can create magnified, distorted, or multiple images of background objects.\n\n3. Dark matter gravitational lensing - This specifically refers to the gravitational lensing effect caused by concentrations of dark matter. It's one of the primary methods scientists use to detect and map dark matter in the universe.\n\nSo dark matter gravitational lensing is a physical phenomenon or effect that we can observe through telescopes and other instruments, but it's not a tangible object that you can touch or hold.

This bending occurs due to the gravitational effects of dark matter on spacetime, even though dark matter itself can't be directly observed with conventional electromagnetic detection methods.\n\nThis is definitely a natural phenomenon. It's an observable effect that occurs naturally in the universe due to the laws of physics. It's similar to regular gravitational lensing (which happens with visible matter too), but specifically refers to the lensing caused by invisible dark matter.\n\nSo yes, dark matter gravitational lensing is a natural phenomenon, similar to the examples mentioned (gravity, weather, light)."

The gravitational lensing effect requires telescopes and specialized imaging/analysis to detect\n3.

Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is thought to account for approximately 85% of the matter in the universe. It doesn't emit, absorb, or reflect light, which makes it extremely difficult to detect directly.\n\nGravitational lensing is a phenomenon where light from a distant source is bent due to the gravitational field of a massive object between the source and the observer.

It's one of the main ways we can detect and study dark matter, by observing how its gravitational effects bend light from distant galaxies or stars.\n\nSo, dark matter gravitational lensing is not a type of star or stellar object like a black hole, neutron star, or pulsar.

Dark matter is believed to make up about 27% of the universe and forms the scaffolding on which visible matter (galaxies, stars, etc.) is distributed.\n\nWhile planets do have gravity and can technically cause very small gravitational lensing effects, dark matter gravitational lensing is not specifically related to planets or planetary systems. It's primarily observed and studied on much larger cosmic scales involving galaxies and galaxy clusters.\n\nSo, to answer the question: Is dark matter gravitational lensing related to planets or planetary systems? No, it's not directly related to or primarily concerned with planets or planetary systems. It's a phenomenon observed on much larger cosmic scales."
