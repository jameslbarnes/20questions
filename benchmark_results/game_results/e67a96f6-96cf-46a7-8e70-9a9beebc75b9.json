It's not related to dust or particles in air\n17. It's not a sound phenomenon\n18. It is directly related to temperature or heat in the atmosphere\n\nThis is a challenging one. The combination of being physical/tangible but not solid, liquid, or gas seems contradictory. However, that could be because the phenomenon exists in a state that's hard to classify.\n\nGiven all the constraints, and especially the final information about it being related to temperature or heat in the atmosphere plus wind/air movement, I'm trying to think of atmospheric phenomena that fit these characteristics.\n\nPotential candidates:\n- Thermal/heat patterns in the atmosphere\n- Air currents driven by temperature differences\n- Thermals (rising columns of warm air)\n- Temperature inversion\n- Heat waves\n\nThermals seem particularly promising as they're tangible in the sense that they can be felt and measured, they're related to both temperature and air movement, they're natural phenomena commonly found at Earth's surface, and they're not easily classified as solid, liquid, or gas but rather as a temperature pattern in the air.\n\nHowever, a heat wave might also fit the criteria, though one might consider it more of a concept than a physical object.\n\nI think the most likely answer is a thermal (rising column of warm air), which glider pilots and birds use to gain altitude."

It's a physical place, a geographical feature, and an ecosystem. While it's not an \"object\" in the sense of a discrete item that can be moved or held, it is certainly physical and tangible - you can visit it, walk through it, touch the trees, etc.\n\nSo is it a physical/tangible object? It's physical and tangible, but calling it an \"object\" might not be the most accurate description. It's more of a place or a geographical feature.\n\nBut in the context of 20 Questions, I think the player is trying to distinguish between physical things and abstract concepts (like love, democracy, etc.). In that context, I would say the Amazon Rainforest is on the physical side of that distinction.\n\nI'll say yes, with a brief clarification that it's a physical place rather than an object per se."

In that sense, forests are indeed common features on Earth's surface.\n\nSince the Amazon Rainforest is located on Earth's surface, and forests/rainforests are common natural features on Earth, I think the most accurate answer is \"yes\"."

The Amazon Rainforest isn't exclusively solid - it contains substantial liquid elements (rivers, rainfall) and gaseous elements (air)\n2.
