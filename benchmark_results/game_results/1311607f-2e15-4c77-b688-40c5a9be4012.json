While entanglement can occur between particles that interact via nuclear forces (like quarks or nucleons), entanglement itself is a more general quantum mechanical property.\n\nEntanglement is a consequence of quantum mechanics broadly, not specifically of nuclear forces. It's more accurate to say entanglement is a fundamental aspect of quantum physics that applies across all interactions, rather than being specifically related to nuclear forces.\n\nSo while quantum entanglement can involve particles that interact via nuclear forces, it is not directly or specifically related to nuclear forces themselves.\n\nThe answer should be \"no\" since quantum entanglement is a quantum mechanical phenomenon that exists independently of the nuclear forces, even though it can involve particles that interact via those forces."
