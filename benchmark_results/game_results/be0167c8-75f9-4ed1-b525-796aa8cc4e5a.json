I'll start with the most fundamental division possible to split the universe of possibilities roughly in half.\n\nFor my first question, I should determine if we're dealing with something physical/tangible or abstract. This is one of the most basic divisions that can help me narrow down possibilities quickly.\n\nAfter that, depending on the answer, I'll follow up with appropriate questions that continue dividing the remaining possibilities efficiently.\n\nI'll make sure my questions are specific, clear, and can be answered with Yes/No/I don't know."

While it does serve some utility purposes today (like being a broadcasting tower, having weather instruments, etc.), its primary design and purpose was not utilitarian or industrial. \n\nIt was built as a temporary exhibition structure to celebrate the centennial of the French Revolution and to demonstrate France's industrial prowess. It was meant to be a cultural landmark, a symbol of French engineering, and a tourist attraction. Today, it continues to serve primarily as a cultural icon and tourist destination.\n\nSo, is the Eiffel Tower primarily designed for a utility or industrial purpose? No, it was primarily designed as a monument/cultural landmark/exhibition piece, though it later gained some utility functions."

It was constructed to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution and to demonstrate France's industrial prowess.\n\nWhile it wasn't built as a monument or memorial in the traditional sense (like the Lincoln Memorial or the Statue of Liberty which explicitly commemorate people or concepts), it was definitely constructed to symbolize French engineering achievements and to serve as a centerpiece for the World's Fair.\n\nToday, the Eiffel Tower has become an iconic symbol of Paris and France as a whole. It wasn't originally intended to be permanent, but it has evolved to represent French culture, engineering, and has become a symbol of Paris itself.\n\nSo was it \"primarily intended to commemorate, symbolize, or represent something\"? It was built for a specific event (the World's Fair) and to showcase French engineering, so it did have symbolic intent from the beginning. It wasn't just a purely functional structure.\n\nI believe the answer is yes, because the Eiffel Tower was built specifically to celebrate the French Revolution centennial and to symbolize French industrial and engineering achievements."
