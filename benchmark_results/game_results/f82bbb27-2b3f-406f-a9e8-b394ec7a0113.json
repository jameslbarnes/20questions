Most people don't maintain blockchain nodes, validate transactions, create smart contracts, or otherwise directly engage with blockchain systems.\n\n3.

It's not exclusively or primarily a business technology, though it certainly has strong business applications.\n\nSo the answer is somewhat mixed. Blockchain does have significant business applications, but it's not limited to or primarily designed for business contexts alone. It has broader applications across multiple domains.\n\nI think the most accurate answer would be \"maybe\" or a qualified \"yes\" with clarification.
