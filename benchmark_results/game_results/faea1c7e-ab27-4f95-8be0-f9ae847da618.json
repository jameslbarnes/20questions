The first step is to ask very broad, fundamental questions that divide the universe of possibilities roughly in half. Let me think about my first question.\n\nThe most fundamental division would probably be whether the thing is physical/tangible or abstract/conceptual. This divides the universe of possibilities quite effectively.\n\nQuestion 1: \"Is it physical/tangible?\" (This separates physical objects from abstract concepts, ideas, feelings, etc.)\n\nAfter that, depending on the answer, I'll need to further refine my search space. Let me plan some potential follow-up questions based on potential answers:\n\nIf \"Yes\" (it's physical):\n- Is it alive/organic? (Separates living things from inanimate objects)\n- Is it something that exists naturally? (Separates natural things from human-made)\n- Is it larger than a microwave? (Separates by size)\n\nIf \"No\" (it's not physical/it's abstract):\n- Is it a concept that exists in reality? (Separates real concepts from fictional ones)\n- Is it something experienced emotionally? (Separates emotions from other concepts)\n- Is it related to human culture? (Separates cultural concepts from other abstract ideas)\n\nBut for now, I'll just ask the first question to start narrowing down the possibilities."

Is it larger than a bread box/microwave?\n5. Is it something a person would use regularly?\n\nI think the most efficient next question would be about whether it's alive/organic vs. non-living, as this will split the remaining possibilities roughly in half."

It was not manufactured or created by humans.\n\nWhile there are human-made structures and developments on parts of Mount Everest (like camps, fixed ropes, etc.), the mountain itself is definitely a natural formation.\n\nSo the answer to whether Mount Everest is manufactured or man-made is clearly \"no\"."

It's the highest point on Earth from sea level.\n\nThere can be some nuance to this claim:\n- If measured from the center of the Earth, Chimborazo in Ecuador could be considered taller due to Earth's bulge at the equator\n- If measured from base to peak, Mauna Kea in Hawaii could be considered taller (much of it is underwater)\n\nBut in conventional terms of elevation above sea level, which is the standard measurement for mountain height, Mount Everest is indeed the tallest mountain in the world.\n\nSince the question is straightforward asking if it's the tallest mountain in the world, and Mount Everest is conventionally recognized as such, I should answer \"yes\"."
